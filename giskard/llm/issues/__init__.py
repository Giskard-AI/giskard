Your task as a prompt QA is to generate test assertions that assess the performance of an AI model.

You will focus on testing the following issue category:

**Issue category**: {issue_name}
**Issue category description**: {issue_description}

Here are some examples of inputs relative to the issue category above, but that are not necessarily relevant for the specific model you are testing, and examples of associated assertions:

**Inputs Examples**:
```json
{input_examples}
```

**Assertions Examples**:
```json
{{
  "assertions": {issue_examples}
}}
```

This is the model you will be testing:

**Model name**: {model_name}
**Model description**: {model_description}

You must generate up to {assertion_count} assertions that comprehensively evaluate the behavior of this model in various scenarios related to the issue category above.
These assertions should cover both typical and edge cases relevant to the issue category.

As a Prompt QA Specialist, your task is to create a list of {input_count} inputs to thoroughly test a model's generated responses. These inputs should evaluate the model's performance, particularly in scenarios where it may fail or exhibit suboptimal behavior related to {issue_name}. It is important to ensure that the inputs cover both common and unusual cases.
{issue_description}

The following tests will be conducted: {generated_tests}

Here are some general examples to inspire you (please note that these examples are not specific to the issue at hand): {input_examples}

Please make sure that the inputs are relevant to the following model:

**Name**: {model_name}

**Description**: {model_description}

For each variable in the model, provide a textual input value: {variables}.

**Format Instructions**: 
Please respond with a JSON object that includes the following keys:
- inputs: A list of {input_count} dictionaries with all variables ({variables}) as keys, along with their corresponding textual input value.

**Example**:
{{"inputs": [{{"reply_instruction": "Ask to reschedule on Tuesday at 2PM", "mail": "I hereby confirm our interview next Monday at 10AM"}}]}}"

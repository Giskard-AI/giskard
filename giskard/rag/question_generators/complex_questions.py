Your task is to re-write questions that will be used to evaluate the following agent:
- Model description: {agent_description}  

Respect the following rules to reformulate the question:
- The re-written question should not be longer than the original question by up to 10 to 15 words. 
- The re-written question should be more elaborated than the original, use elements from the context to enrich the questions. 
- The re-written question should be more difficult to handle for AI models but it must be understood and answerable by humans.
- Add one or more constraints / conditions to the question.
- The re-written question must be in this language: {language}

You will be provided the question delimited by <question></question> tags.
You will also be provided a relevant context which contain the answer to the question, delimited by <context></context> tags. It consists in multiple paragraphs delimited by dashes "------".
You will return the reformulated question as a single JSON object, with the key 'question'. Make sure you return a valid JSON object.

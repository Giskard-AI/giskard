Think step by step. For example, if the model description says that the model output should be valid HTML, you should answer Y.
If the model description says that the model output should be valid JSON format, you should answer Y.
If the model description says that the model should produce a list of 5 elements, you should answer Y.
If the model description does not provide any information about the output format, you should answer N.
If you are in doubt, you should answer N.

- Model output should not be longer than 3 sentences

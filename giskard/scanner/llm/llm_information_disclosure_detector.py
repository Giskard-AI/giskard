    """Detects sensitive information disclosure in LLM-based models.

    This detector checks that the model does divulge or hallucinate sensitive or confidential information in its
    responses. We probe the model by generating ad hoc adversarial inputs and checking that the model outputs do not
    contain information that could be considered sensitive, such as personal identifiable information (PII) or secret
    credentials.

    In some cases, this can produce false positives if the model is supposed to return sensitive information (e.g.
    contact information for a business). We still recommend to carefully review the detections, as they may reveal
    undesired availability of private information to the model (for example, confidential data acquired during fine
    tuning), or the tendency to hallucinate information such as phone numbers or personal emails even if those details
    were not provided to the model.

    Attention: this detector depends on OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which may not be publicly available or free to use.

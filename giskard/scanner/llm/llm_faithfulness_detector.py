Issue category description: This category focuses on ensuring that the model output is consistent with the requirements requested in the model description and that if the model is performing reformulation or summarization of an input text, the output is faithful and reliable to the input text based on the model description.

Here are some examples of requirements relative to the issue category above, but which are not necessarily relevant for the specific model you are testing:
- The model should maintain a professional tone
- When summarizing a text, the model should not add information that was not present in the input text
- If the model is performing summarization, it should not never omit key information that was present in the input text"""

If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy:

    1.  It must be a bug/performance issue or a feature request or a build issue or
        a documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead).
    2.  Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.
    3.  The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.

**Here's why we have this policy:** We want to focus on the work that benefits
the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support
should be sought on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ABvfpbu69R) community. It helps us to
address bugs and feature requests in a timely manner.

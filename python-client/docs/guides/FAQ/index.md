## How to disable telemetry?

Telemetry enables the Giskard team to detect bugs and plannify the product roadmap. The raw user data is never sent, only metadata. 

If you want to disable telemetry, it's simple you just need to :
- **On the Giskard server**: Go to the settings tab, and deactivate telemetry in the Usage reporting section
- **On Python side**: define the GSK_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=True environment variable

		 Subject: Memo Re State Processes for Takeover of Transmission

Here is an initial draft from our attorneys in California on the state 
processes that could be required.  In my experience, the single biggest issue 
the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way -- there are 
thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried 
eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to 
finish that process.

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

4,59,REGULATION,Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas,"
Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.

We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.

On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.

Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).

Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:

(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.

As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:

""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.

The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.

Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.

Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.",Tuesday,2001,September,6,0

They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to ""resolve"" the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th.  Of course, this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one), and not the PJM model that others prefer to use.  We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version, even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting, or simply ""agree to disagree.""

I have attached a memo outlining the edits that NERC would make in the

that have been circulated in the last day or so.  I've also attached a
marked-up version of the 7/19 draft indicating our changes.

I propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday, August 9, at 10:00
a.m., with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation that
is shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills, but
that still preserves the essence of an industry self-regulatory
organization.  I am working on a location and expect to provide that
information tomorrow.

I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and that
schedules are already full, but schedules will become even more
difficult later in the month.  I take as our deadline having new

the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for

bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to 
them.  All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise

Fenosa and Enron to Invest $550 Million in Dominican Republic

     Madrid, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Union Electrica Fenosa SA,
Spain's third-biggest power company, and Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, will invest together in the Dominican
Republic, kicking off the alliance by building a $550 million
power plant and re-gasification facility.
     The partners will build a natural-gas-fired power station
whose 500-megawatt capacity will represent 30 percent of the
country's current electricity demand, said Fenosa in a note,
confirmed with the company.
     The generator will run on liquefied natural gas when it
starts operating in 2002, switching to fuel from the re-
gasification plant when it starts operating in 2003.
     Fenosa has had an alliance with International Power Plc,
formerly National Power Plc, since 1998. That alliance focuses on
Europe, the U.S. and Australia, a Fenosa spokeswoman said today.
     Enron was the first U.S. utility to receive licenses to buy,
sell and import electricity in Spain, after the government started
opening energy markets to competition in 1998. It's also licensed
to market natural gas.
     The Texas-based utility is building a gas-fired power plant
in southern Spain, has a wind turbine factory near Toledo, and
plans another windmill factory in Catalonia.

DJ Union Fenosa/Enron -2: Construction To Begin 2001 >E.FEN
10/10/0 12:40 (New York)



  MADRID (Dow Jones)--Spanish electricity company Union Electrica Fenosa SA
(E.FEN) said late Tuesday it has reached an agreement with U.S. energy company
Enron (ENE) to invest in energy infrastructure projects in the Dominican
Republic.
  In a release, Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of a
combined-cycle power plant with a 500MW potency, which will use natural gas
from a regasification plant on the island nation.
  The 500MW potency is equivalent to 30% of the Caribbean island's electricity
demand.
  The deal also includes a complimentary project, Fenosa said. This is the
construction of a regasification plant on the republic's coastline, with a
capacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups of
combined-cycle plants with a potency of 1300MW.
  The investment for these two projects is seen at around $550 million, of
which $100 million could come from Dominican companies, Fenosa said.
  Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin 
in
early 2001, with the power plant coming online in 2002. It will operate with
combustible liquid until 2003, at which time the regasification plant comes
online.

16,166,REGULATION,Legislative Update -- Two Track In The Senate and House Update,"We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and 
the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.

In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing 
efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee ""bully pulpit"" to 
pressure FERC into more action.  This effort is led by incoming chairman 
Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying they 
will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC 
takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.

The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee 
chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have the 
legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms 
of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broad 
oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including 
FERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman 
today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.

In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 
featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps 
last month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the 
anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will 
also testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments 
against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20 
the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its 
duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates 
are just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majority 
staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses 
(i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).

We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman 
Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including 
relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times 
article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present no 
indicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as you 
might imagine, paying close attention to this situation.

Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write 
to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the 
entire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it can 
implement ""negawatts"" demand reduction administratively.  We are in the 
process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.

Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up 
portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the 
month unfolds. ",Thursday,2001,June,11,0

The IT group put it like this...""Justification:  Current Server is  PL1850, 
and has reached it's capacity and is non-redundant.""

That means that our current system:
(1) has a slow processor
(2) is nearly out of memory for stock award administration
(3) doesn't have a ""real-time"" back up in case the hard drives fails
(4) needs to be upgraded

The IT group has quoted about $19,000 for a new system that brings this 
server up to Enron's current server standards and takes care of the above 
issues.

Let me know if this expense is a problem and whether you need to be involved 
with these types of decisions in the future.

Thanks,
Aaron

HEADLINE: Southern Co., Regulators Clash in Power-Grid Fight 

BYLINE: By Matthew C. Quinn 

BODY: 
Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. 

But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. 

At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. 

Regional transmission organizations ""yield significant customer savings,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. 

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. 

Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. 

There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. ""It impacts the ability to keep the lights on,"" he said. 

Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. 

""We've got low prices and a reliable system,"" said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. 

""Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle,"" Wise said. ""There are some parallels that make us squirm."" 

PSC Chairman Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. ""This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid,"" he said. 

But the federal commission has only toughened its position. 

Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a ""stick"" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a ""new world"" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. 

The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the ""brightest minds available"" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. 

Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. 

Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. 

The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. 

Large regional grids are ""more cost-effective and reliable"" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. 

By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. 

But Wise called such predictions ""totally unproven.""

f California  State Capitol  Sacramento, California 95814  Dear Governor Da=
vis:              As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently c=
onsidered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist Califo=
rnia in resolving its energy supply crisis.  One of these measures was a te=
mporary ""safe harbor"" provision, effective only upon the California Governo=
r's request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplant=
s from challenges under the Clean Air Act.              During the course o=
f six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the Calif=
ornia electric crisis, including two hearings on draft legislation, Members=
 of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants we=

ed operation between state air officials and the powerplants.  Nevertheless=
, California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of you=
r state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary=
.              I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the=
 concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our int=
erpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate.  On Jun=
e 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against t=
hree electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero po=
wer plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emerg=
ency extended operation.  On the same day, the City and County of San Franc=
isco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the=
 three Potrero units.  All parties involved in the litigation strongly asse=
rt that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and th=
e Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all availa=
ble legal remedies under federal and state law.              The legal acti=
on against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extende=
d operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fine=
s potentially amounting to millions of dollars.  Understandably, as a resul=
t of this potentially huge fine, the operator of the Potrero power plant ha=
s filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify t=
hat it will not be required to operate the three generating units, even dur=
ing periods of electrical emergency.  Thus, the mere filing of this lawsuit=
 could have a near-term impact of the amount of power available in Californ=
ia.              Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that subs=
tantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other faci=
lities in California could also be subject to similar legal action.  The Ca=
lifornia Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 mega=
watts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hou=
rs of operation.  In addition, several new units are being brought on-line =
this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment.  According to=
 incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board=
 (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may e=
xhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prio=
r to this summer's peak demand period.  These units may represent up to 2% =
of generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a =
Stage III electric emergency.              Although presented with written =
requests for information from the Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could no=
t or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that=
 may have been off-line due to permit limits, a projection of the number of=
 generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such u=
nits to be off-line, the amount of generation associated with these facilit=
ies, the possible impact of these units on system reliability, and addition=
al information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operat=
ing under ""modified"" conditions.   We believe that in the face of the pendi=
ng legal action, it is even more important that such information be accurat=
ely and objectively determined.              As we mentioned above, over se=
veral months in the spring and early summer of this year, the Committee sou=
ght California's support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to pr=
otect the extended operation of certain powerplants.  Regrettably, the Comm=
ittee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes=
 to the law, as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this=
 letter.  Instead, witnesses representing California claimed such a legal s=

 and local air quality districts are legal.  The pending litigation challen=

ent legal ""flexibility"" to keep these units running during times of emergen=
cy.  It is time, then, to reconsider this issue.              So that the C=

specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopa=

clear idea of the power production which is at risk.  (2) In view of the fa=

horities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether you will now favor =
creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutral safe harbor for =
these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to =

This responds to Charles's voice mail and the RTO conference calls that Janel has been on where we have discussed responding to those who say the heightened interest in security is a reason NOT to do large RTOs.  Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness on reliability and other issues at a Barton subcommittee hearing next Wed., Oct. 10th.  While the written testimony filed for the Sept. 11 hearing that was canceled is still operative, Jim's oral remarks can be whatever he wishes.  Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A.

Thus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing.  Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality.  Just something for Jim to consider using.

22,172,INTERNAL,Confidential - Calif Peaking Plant,"Phil--
	Enron is currently evaluating the possibility of installing an NGL peaking facility with appurtenant storage and rail facilities near Needles, California.  Ideally, the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system.

Current gas pipeline specs are as follows:
	Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig, worst case 750, normal range 800-900
	Gas Volume - 650,000 - 750,000 MMBtu/day
	
	Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450,000 gallons/day (18,750 gal/ per hour)


My questions are:

1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so, where?

2)  Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane?

3)  At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls?

4)  Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so, at what price (ball park here, don't go way out of your way)?  (If it's not, what would your suggestion be for a design).

I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number).

As always, we're on a pretty tight time frame.  After you've had a chance to review the above, I'd like to get together and discuss this with you.  I can meet you in Ohio if it fits your schedule better, just let me know.  Thanks for the help and I look forward to talking with you soon.

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

Subject: FERC's Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for CA Wholesale 
Electric Markets

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

Subject:	Enron Expatriates in India

Steve,

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India.  There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources.

As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there.

We have developed an intranet site/database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue. The intranet site will be placed on the 
home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. 
However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs. 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:
California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories.

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information. The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, 
i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points 
and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted.

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser.)

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power 
Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. 

To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your 
user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then 
type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is 
all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, 
preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter 
your new network password.) 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 
713-853-4382.

California Adopts Variable Pricing, Raising Ire of Generators, Traders
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/30/2000
The Wall Street Journal
A4
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated 
energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already 
is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised 
by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. 
Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the 
California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency 
responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on 
wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at 
low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It 
was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap 
on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- 
soaring total power costs.
The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power 
market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In 
other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped 
at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent 
market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new 
plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because 
utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but 
weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other 
markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on 
the spot market, where most power trades. 
During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale 
electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a 
year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained 
above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those 
power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per 
megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for 
that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. 
California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the 
state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, 
the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, 
less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities 
there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities 
weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 
13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members 
representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big 
investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this 
year. 
Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet 
down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David 
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to 
ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" 
But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even 
worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam 
Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State 
University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too 
low and make your supply problems even worse."" 
Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based 
regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University 
who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, 
it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" 
For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days 
in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then 
sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it 
could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather 
than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In 
the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened 
transmission system. 
In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward 
electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for 
power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 
1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. 
""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing 
director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro 
said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. 
It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is 
expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's 
market structure. That order will include its determination of the 
effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the 
governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. 
Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the 
business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to 
California residents. 
The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of 
executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO 
Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't 
take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. 
Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to 
neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically 
interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase 
the highest prices. 
""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter 
said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly 
throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so 
that it could take itself private. 
Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, 
suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share 
for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the 
offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix 
made its debut in 1999.
An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet 
decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the 
company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our 
investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, 
Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. 
Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron 
had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading 
skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But 
Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business 
and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, 
were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, 
accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the 
capital-intensive water business. 
The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's 
international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron 
executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief 
executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the 
company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was 
believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, 
herself. She declined a request for an interview. 
In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four 
offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which 
came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a 
lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by 
Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities 
litigation. 
In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that 
there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own 
offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a 
better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that 
Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but 
said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Wessex switch likely

(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000)

Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a 
disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. 
Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by 
Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's 
expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, 
since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into 
freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because 
it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities.
It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that 
is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to 
lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held 
shares, thereby taking it private. 
The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 
63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex 
Water if it went private.

Enron water unit could go private under loan plan

Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about 
$275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that 
are publicly traded. 
The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about 
double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for 
Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public 
in June 1999.
The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol 
Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's 
least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up 
its ambitious plans. 
""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. 
""This is a solution to a problem."" 
Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's 
proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the 
proposal's structure had not been outlined. 
Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to 
withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and 
employees deteriorated. 
One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the 
buyout. 
The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns 
a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which 
Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. 
The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the 
market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at 
$6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility 
in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and 
administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign 
competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost 
structure has been its primary problem, she said. 
Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new 
president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date 
that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief 
executive. 
Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine 
months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate 
development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
One alternative was selling the company, he said. 
That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 
per share. 
The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said 
Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity 
of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities 
litigation. 
""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" 
Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no 
other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later 
withdrawn) by the fourth bidder.""

Quietly, Bush's team talks about transition; Plenty of folks in Austin would 
love to follow Bush to D.C.
Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief

10/28/2000
Austin American-Statesman
A1
(Copyright 2000)

Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. 
George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in 
state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House 
posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes 
president. 
Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the 
appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion 
indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds.
Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. 
And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House 
transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush 
headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between 
looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. 
The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of 
transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks 
backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his 
running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up 
in his administration. 
The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush 
friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial 
appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has 
been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks 
who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. 
Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went 
well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing 
administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were 
ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that 
can make the mistakes, he said. 
There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in 
August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition 
handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" 
""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would 
discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start 
planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the 
scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 
70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between 
the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial 
success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a 
foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. 
All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with 
Johnson at the helm. 
Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be 
overloaded with Texans. 
""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. 
Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered 
shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. 
Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early 
speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for 
head of personnel at the White House. 
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial 
campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White 
House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, 
though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the 
Republican National Committee. 
Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the 
""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have 
been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager 
of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the 
governor's office. 
Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House 
post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of 
staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the 
megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. 
However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's 
legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. 
In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has 
sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. 
Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on 
Jan. 20. 
Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, 
perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. 
That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the 
Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a 
home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also 
has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. 
Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. 
Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the 
Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. 
If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor 
complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's 
office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After 
all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial 
inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. 
No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford 
ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet 
members.

Dynegy: Calif Price Caps Will Compromise Elec Reliability

10/27/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California 
Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the 
wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to 
sell electricity out of state.
""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot 
operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to 
participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading 
asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the 
power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" 
The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast 
load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take 
effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 
3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 
meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about 
reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader 
listening in to a conference call between the three companies.

SEC Filing Shows 3rd Parties Contacted Enron About Azurix
By Christopher C. Williams

10/27/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy 
trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company 
private in a $7-a-share buyout.
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made 
the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four 
third parties for its stake in Azurix. 
In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential 
buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market 
price of approximately $4 a share."" 
Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share 
offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given 
by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital 
structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities 
litigation,"" the letter said. 
Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether 
Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with 
other parties regarding its Azurix stake. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to 
$6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 
shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, 
compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. 
In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial 
and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned 
upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. 
""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's 
shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these 
options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater 
return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. 
Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other 
""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition 
that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. 
Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is 
now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the 
information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the 
filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. 
She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. 
In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position 
with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore 
reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. 
In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two 
""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate 
strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to 
unrelated third parties. 
Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a 
share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's 
best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and 
employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix
Financial Times
By Hillary Durgin in Houston
Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT


Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had 
offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of 
$7 per share. 
The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron 
said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of 
any decision was unclear. 
Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled 
Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. 
The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at 
Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price 
of $19 per share. 
But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and 
empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, 
whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around 
the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive 
officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. 
Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying 
its stake in Azurix. 
While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price 
of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per 
share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined 
to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining 
the buyout proposal. 
""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public 
stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit 
Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their 
shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have 
traded in several months."" 
Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 
per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that 
Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic 
of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. 
Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 
to close at $6.56.

As with the CFA report by Mark Cooper several months ago, these consumer groups are important to showing third party support for our efforts, particularly among Democrats in Congress.

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it 
""creates
  tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

An example is Enron, the Houston energy conglomerate, which even suggests how 
much employees should give.
Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his 
stationery asking them to contribute
$1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said Steven J. Kean, an executive vice 
president. This year, Enron and its
employees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush campaign, he said. 

But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. ''We might tell employees 
to go out and vote, but nobody tells
them who to vote for or passes out brochures,'' Mr. Kean said. ''That kind of 
thing is just not acceptable in today's
workplace.''

All--here's some thoughts on the RGA related events.  We currently have Ken 
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon 
of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, 
Hull, Geringer and Ridge.  (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall 
event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session).  Kaufman and I 
thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho 
Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him.  

I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening 
(6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe 
will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some 
sections of the RGA events.  I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that 
we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning.

If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that 
day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit.  Paul and I will cover the RGA 
events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to 
talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime 
in the near future.  Same with Rowe.

California Blame Game Yields No Score --- Probes Reveal Little Evidence

LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one 
thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an 
electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. 
In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric 
against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that 
supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such 
as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price 
gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity 
producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is 
backing a bill that would make energy price fixing a felony, and as a private 
citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court.
About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging 
from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's 
office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months 
-- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. 
While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the 
question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney 
General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of 
millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. 
Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges 
against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would 
love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 
cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, 
honey,'"" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading 
company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California 
market. 
Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. 
Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay ""is so counterproductive that it doesn't 
merit a response."" 
Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual 
firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote 
efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding 
supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages 
the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market 
power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity 
in the state since early last year. 
A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin 
Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a 
company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market 
power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. 
Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken 
against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above 
""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California 
suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of 
that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the 
suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. 
The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of 
price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched 
state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market 
purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build 
enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of 
manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" 
says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
industry trade group. 
Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, 
particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in 
natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible 
manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject 
of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. 
While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the 
investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. 
For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to 
enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc., and Southern 
Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning 
over certain business documents they deemed confidential. 
Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are 
going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand 
fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand 
megawatts can power about one million homes. 
Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight 
supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them 
more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This 
combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat 
out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., 
which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 
2000 than in 1999. 
At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned 
outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, 
a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance 
committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say 
that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether 
such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. 
Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in 
a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions 
about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in 
order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., 
Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which 
markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to 
reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. 
In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" 
to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for 
extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily 
divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES 
settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million 
to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says 
the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any 
conversations of that nature"" in the future. 
Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. 
According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its 
plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was 
cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of 
the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company 
substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. 
If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in 
maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, 
particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior 
utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an 
operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service.""

Enron Unit Moves to End India Contract For Power
By SARITHA RAI

05/22/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

BANGALORE, India, May 21 -- Fed up with its main customer's refusal to pay 
its bills, the Enron Corporation's Indian power-generating venture served 
formal notice on Saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract 
and pull out. 
The move by the Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron, starts the 
clock ticking on a six-month notice period before the contract is voided, 
during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected. The $2.9 
billion Dabhol project represents the largest single foreign investment in 
India.
Separately, Enron said today that it was withdrawing from a pipeline project 
in Qatar, which would have supplied some gas to Dabhol. The company said that 
the two steps were unrelated. 
The Dabhol project has been the subject of a series of wrangles between the 
company and the governments of India and of the western Indian state of 
Maharashtra. The state-owned utility company that contracted to buy power 
from the Dabhol plant has defaulted on some $64 million in unpaid power 
bills, and has accused Dabhol of charging too much. 
Dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the termination 
notice after both governments failed to honor their contractual commitments 
to buy and pay for its output. 
But in a statement issued over the weekend, Dabhol said it was ''still open 
to constructive discussion on the solutions.'' The company said a ''lasting 
and feasible solution'' to the dispute would require that the two governments 
either honor their obligations to buy Dabhol's power or find other 
creditworthy buyers to take the power instead. 
The first phase of the project now generates 740 megawatts of power, and the 
second phase, adding another 1,444 megawatts of capacity, is scheduled to go 
on line next month. 
Under the contract, the termination that Enron has set in motion would oblige 
the federal and state governments to pay damages to Enron and the lenders 
that financed the project, possibly as much as $500 million -- the value of a 
year's output of power plus the project's $300 million in debt -- if it is 
shut down.

The State GOP Criticizes Davis' Choice of PR Aides Capitol: Legislative 
leaders call the pair political operatives who are too partisan to represent 
the state during energy crisis.

SACRAMENTO -- Republican legislative leaders Monday blasted Gov. Gray Davis' 
decision to spend $30,000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications 
consultants known for their highly partisan work. 
Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as ""cut-throat,"" Senate 
GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave 
Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring ""undermines the 
assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis.""
Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay 
them a combined $30,000 a month for at least the next six months. 
""We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government 
payroll,"" Brulte said in an interview. ""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. 
The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political 
opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay 
for them with his $30-million political war chest."" 
Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' 
work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting 
business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political 
support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial 
difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in 
Sacramento. 
On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. 
""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or 
individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter 
said. 
Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice 
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as 
attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision 
to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside 
experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to 
help the governor fight against these generators."" 
""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters 
to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging 
California. . . . That is the real issue here."" 
Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of 
fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been 
scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed 
for bankruptcy protection. 
""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' 
campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of 
the generators that Davis has criticized. 
Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday 
with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. 
After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor 
Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth 
Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive 
warnings two or three days in advance. 
Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in 
advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" 
It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate 
to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather 
than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, 
Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete 
transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark 
until workers can fix it.

EUROPE/MIDEAST 
Insurer Storebrand
Favors Sampo's Bid 
Over Den Norske 
Norway's largest insurer, Storebrand, became the center of a bidding war 
between Finnish financial-services company Sampo and Norway's Den Norske 
Bank, with Storebrand favoring Sampo. Sampo's offer values Storebrand at 20.8 
billion Norwegian kroner ($2.3 billion), compared with DnB's 17.6 billion 
kroner bid, as the Nordic region's top financial companies battle for 
position in a consolidating sector. Sampo and Storebrand, in a joint Helsinki 
news conference, said they were confident their deal would succeed. 
Sampo's cash-and-stock offer, valued at 75 kroner a share, represents a 31% 
premium to Storebrand's average share price during the past month and was 
backed by Storebrand's management. DnB wouldn't say whether it would alter 
its bid. ""One cannot count on that,"" its chairman said. 
HypoVereinsbank Results Disappoint 
Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank, Germany's second-largest bank, known as 
HypoVereinsbank, said first-quarter pretax profit rose 25% from a year 
earlier to 770 million euros ($678 million), below analysts' consensus 
forecast of 795 million euros. Profit rose 63% to 468 million euros; earnings 
and pretax profit were both helped by one-time gains of 454 million euros. 
Operating profit fell 59% in the retail-banking division to 98 million euros, 
and was down 43% in the international-markets division to 184 million euros. 
HypoVereinsbank said tough market conditions world-wide reduced regular 
commission and interest income. 
Enron Pulls Out of Emirates Gas Project 
U.S. energy company Enron has decided to pull out of the multibillion-dollar 
Dolphin natural-gas project, selling its 24.5% stake to the United Arab 
Emirates Offsets Group, or UOG, according to Dolphin Energy's managing 
director, Ahmed Al-Sayigh. He didn't specify the reason for Enron's 
withdrawal or the value of Enron's stake. The Dolphin project agreement, 
reached two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, aims to bring two billion 
cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field in the 
Persian Gulf to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and France's 
TotalFinaElf each held a 24.5% stake, with UOG owning the remaining 51%. Mr. 
Sayigh said UOG will hold discussions with other companies on a possible sale 
of Enron's original stake. Richard Bergester, manager for Enron Middle East, 
said that having contributed to the project's initial stages, Enron now feels 
it can't ""add"" any more. He didn't elaborate. A TotalFinaElf official said it 
is interested in a greater stake in Dolphin. 
Marc Rich Gains Control of Swiss Firm 
Marc Rich, the former U.S. fugitive given a controversial pardon by President 
Clinton, effectively pulled off a management coup at Swiss real-estate 
company Feldschloesschen-Huerlimann Holding by thwarting its merger plans 
with Swiss Prime Site and forcing the board to quit. Feldschloesschen's 
ousted chairman, Robert Jeker, said Marc Rich Group now had control of the 
company. Mr. Rich himself is not on the board, but he controls more than 10% 
of the votes in Feldschloesschen.

Enron Corp. pulled out of a $2-billion pipeline project to export gas from 
Qatar as it became increasingly likely that an Indian power-sales agreement 
will collapse. The company said the move is not related to a filing by its 
65%-owned Dabhol Power Co. to India's Maharashtra state's electricity board 
to stop supplying power because it's owed about $63.9 million by the board.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-Indian state spurred by Enron reopens power deals.
By Narayanan Madhavan

05/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BANGALORE, India, May 22 (Reuters) - India's technology state of Karnataka, 
spurred by a payments row involving U.S. power developer Enron Corp in a 
neighbouring province, has reopened sealed power purchase deals with 11 
private firms. 
The southern state's government has told independent power producers (IPPs), 
which are yet to start generation, that they need to make their tariffs more 
competitive, officials said.
""Now it (electricity) cannot be at any cost,"" V.P. Baligar, chairman and 
managing director of the Karnataka State Power Transmission Corp Ltd (KPTCL), 
the state's monopoly power distributor, told Reuters in an interview late on 
Monday. 
The move comes on the heels of the bitter wrangle in Maharashtra state 
involving Dabhol Power Co, 65-percent owned by Houston-based Enron. 
Dabhol issued a preliminary notice on Saturday to end a contract to sell 
power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The step came after 
Maharashtra ceased payments saying Dabhol's tariffs were too high. 
The $2.9-billion project, which is 90-percent complete, was first billed as a 
showcase of India's decade-old reform programme but now is regarded by 
critics as a symbol of policy bungling. ""Enron is a lesson for all of us,"" 
Baligar said. 
Karnataka also said it would not provide financial assurances in the form of 
escrow cover and government loan guarantees which the firms wanted to help 
sweeten lending rates. 
""We're trying to tell them your tariff has to be competitive,"" Baligar said, 
but added that the state was open to negotiations. ""You have to have the 
final capability so you can implement the project without any guarantee or 
escrow."" 
SIGNED DEALS 
Five years ago, the state signed power purchase deals with 14 private firms. 
Three of them are already generating power at rates higher than the state 
would now like to pay. They will continue to get these rates but the 11 
unbuilt units face an uncertain future. 
The 11 plants involve 2,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity, half of which would 
be supplied by the Mangalore Power Co (MPC) from which U.S.-based Cogentrix 
exited in 1999, citing litigation and delays in government approval. 
China Light & Power now owns the company, in which India's Tata group is 
expected to take 30 percent. MPC Managing Director V.P. Sharma told Reuters 
that his firm's project would not be hit by the demand for lower tariffs 
because it was based on coal unlike the Enron project, based on naphtha. 
""Our cost is the lowest cost approved (and) coal prices have fallen (since 
the agreement),"" Sharma told Reuters from Bombay. Company officials say the 
project is also looking forward to a federal guarantee to help it move 
forward. 
Baligar said the government's intention was to weed out those who are not 
serious. ""Those who are serious can sit with us and sort out their problems,"" 
he said. 
Power tariffs vary, depending upon foreign exchange rates and the type and 
prices of fuels. Three projects which are already generating power get about 
3.0 to 4.0 rupees (6.4 to 8.5 U.S. cents) per unit. The 11 uninstalled plants 
had comparable rates but MPC says falling coal prices helped its 
competitiveness. 
One generating firm, Jindal Tractabel, which uses coal and gas, gets about 
2.60 rupees. Its purchase agreement was not among the 14 and is awaiting 
regulatory approval. The state wants the Jindal rate to be the benchmark for 
reopened agreements. 
If private firms cut capital costs and work out long-term fuel supplies, they 
will be able to cut rates, Baligar said. 
The state says it needs 4,000 MW of new capacity over 10 years and 2,500 MW 
over five years. State-run utilities are in a position to meet five-year 
needs at low rates, Baligar said. 
Asked if Karnataka could face litigation over the reopening of the contracts, 
Baligar had legally strong arguments. ( $1 = 46.9 rupees).

INDIA: India utility may slap 4bln rupee fine on Enron unit.

05/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 22 (Reuters) - An Indian utility is planning to impose a second 
penalty of four billion rupees ($85 million) on Enron's local unit, barely a 
week after the U.S. energy giant took its first step to pull out of the 
embattled project. 
A senior official at the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) said on 
Tuesday the fine on Dabhol Power Company (DPC) was for not meeting capacity 
targets within a stipulated period.
""We will do this as soon as the bill for May is received next month,"" the 
official told Reuters. 
DPC officials declined to comment on the matter. 
Earlier this year, MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has 
not paid - saying its plant could not be ramped up to full capacity within 
three hours from a cold start. 
Enron and MSEB have been battling for six months over payment defaults and 
last week DPC, owned 65 percent by Enron, issued a preliminary notice to 
terminate a power purchase agreement - widely seen as a move that would lead 
to a pull out. 
According to DPC, it is owed $48 million by MSEB. 
A top government official told Reuters in Delhi on Monday the federal 
government is optimistic Houston-based Enron and the Maharashtra state will 
resolve their wrangle. 
The agreement signed between MSEB and DPC in 1995 stipulates that if Dabhol's 
plant cannot achieve 100 percent capacity within three hours from restart, 
MSEB is entitled to impose a penalty. 
The MSEB official said the plant had failed to fulfil this condition in 
February and March, considered peak periods for power demand by the utility. 
DPC is building a $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW plant, of which the first phase of 
740 MW began operations in May 1999. 
Enron is India's largest foreign investor. ($1=47.0 Indian rupees).

Power corrupts...

05/22/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

APROPOS of Enrons notice to the government of Maharashtra, Mumbai should act 
pragmatically instead of indulging in heroics and rhetoric. It should set its 
own house in order, improve MSEBs functioning and quickly privatise.
If it fails to do these its threat to Enron will also be taken as just 
another case of demanding kickbacks. 
IT is sad really that Enron had to issue its pre-termination notice. We 
should now ask whether MSEB would be able to construct such a project in 
record time. 
Corruption is rampant in MSEB. They may say Enron power is not needed, but 
you cannot even get a new connection easily. Interruptions are commonplace in 
rural areas (sometimes up to four times a week). 
Power thefts are commonplace too. Each day, on average, we pay MSEB about Rs 
6 per unit for commercial connections. But most people would be willing to 
pay Rs 7 or so if they got clean, uninterrupted power. 
We have seen, for example, the vast cost overruns of many of the official 
water management projects. These overruns go up to 20 times, with delays 
stretching up to 10 years with no guarantee no results even then. 
All told, the government is sending very wrong signals to the international 
community by raking up the Enron controversy. It should set its own house in 
order. 
THE new state ministries are too big in size West Bengals in particular. It 
has allotted one minister just to deal with fire brigades. The expenditure in 
lakhs it entails could exceed the total number of fire tenders under the 
department. 
Despite that it needed 7 complete days to control a recent fire (with private 
tankers requisitioned to help over and above the ones owned by the 
corporation and municipalities). 
We need more fire tenders, not ministers or those who are associated with the 
big boss. Also we need a new minister, plus a full-fledged department, to 
examine corrupt practices in local government and also in the central 
government offices located in states. 
Meanwhile, was the Sarkaria Commissions recommendation to restrict the size 
of the ministry to within 10 per cent of the size of the Assembly advanced 
only to be flouted? 
We should call a stop to such commissions as not even 10 per cent of their 
purpose is served; they too entail huge establishments which are maintained 
year after year at taxpayer expense. 
SINCE 1993, I have been familiar with the political, social and business 
scenarios in the US and so I feel reasonably qualified to make some 
observations on US immigration policy by Sudhir Shah. 
Shahs statistics are not totally accurate but they depict the `global 
picture. The Indian immigrants (a million plus now) are, in many respects, a 
class apart. 
Their education levels are far higher than those of other immigrants, many of 
whom are just a grade above our rag-pickers (they are the cherry and berry 
pickers on US farms). 
I have not come across a single uneducated Indian in the US since 1983. Even 
in asset-formation, Indians (even Pakistanis) are leagues ahead of the other 
immigrants.

The Godbole findings
Our Editorial

05/22/2001
Business Standard
15
Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Godbole committee's first report, submitted on 10 April, is an eye-opener 
to what can only be called a massive scandal. It leaves several players MSEB, 
successive Maharashtra governments, the Kirit Parikh re-negotiation exercise, 
the Central Electricity Authority, and other players in New Delhi with no 
clothes on. MSEB claimed that it had negotiated a tariff that was lower than 
would result from applying the central government's standard formula. But 
this was patently fraudulent, because the comparison was based on wrong 
numbers, incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions (one 
rupee-dollar rate for the Dabhol tariff, another for calculating the 
government formula), all of it designed to establish what was not true. Asked 
in court why there had been no competitive bidding, the answer (believe it or 
not) was that MSEB was not competent to handle competitive bidding. But it 
was so wonderfully capable of handling direct tariff negotiations that it 
eventually gave Dabhol a higher tariff than Enron had initially sought, 
before the negotiations began!
That's only for starters. There is much more in the Godbole report. On the 
basis of a passing comment in an FIPB meeting, that the project's costs were 
broadly in line with other similar projects, the power secretary in New Delhi 
tells the Central Electricity Authority that the CEA's techno-economic 
clearance is not required though this is statutorily mandated. The CEA agrees 
to this untenable proposition, but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on 
the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the Godbole 
committee. The re-gasification project that was made part of the power 
project had a capacity to handle 5 million tonnes, though Dabhol itself 
needed only 2.1 million tonnes. A port facility had similar excess capacity. 
Yet the entire cost of these facilities was loaded on to Dabhol, along with 
the full cost of the 20-year gas supply contract. Thus, as the Godbole 
committee observes, what should have been a variable cost was converted to 
part of the fixed cost, which MSEB would have to service through a capacity 
charge, whether any power or gas was bought or not. Even the power 
requirements of Maharashtra were mis-calculated in order to over-ride a 
warning from the World Bank that the Dabhol power would not be needed. This 
was done by assuming that industrial demand for power would grow overnight at 
twice the earlier rate, and that MSEB itself would overnight see a dramatic 
worsening of its operating parameters. There is still more in the report, but 
the point should be obvious. What the report shows is that the Dabhol 
contract can be subjected to legal test (as in fact two members of the 
Godbole committee recommend), on the grounds that it was improperly handled 
and violative of law and common sense. If a favourable judicial decision 
becomes possible, that should help mitigate the costs of winding up a truly 
scandalous project. For reasons that are not clear, MSEB and the Maharashtra 
government have chosen not to go down this route. Perhaps they have greater 
and continuing faith in the re-negotiation process.

SMARTMONEY.COM: Power Grab
By Elizabeth Harris

05/21/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Feeling squeezed by rising electricity bills and 
shrinking investment returns? Consider investing in utilities, which posted 
solid gains amid the recent bear-market carnage. 
But plugging into this volatile sector is risky business, as anyone who piled 
in this year based on energy's surge in 2000 can testify. After returning 
7.28% last year as demand for power outstripped supply, the average utilities 
fund is so far down 1% through May 18, according to the fund research firm 
Morningstar.
Though the sector's prospects remain attractive, such volatility is par for 
the course, says Mark Beckwith, portfolio manager of the Vanguard Utilities 
Income fund (VGSUX). Utilities and funds that focus on the sector no longer 
perform like bonds, delivering most of the gains via relatively predictable 
dividend yields. Instead, the industry has greater growth prospects (and the 
correspondingly higher potential for losses) tied to the fluctuating demand 
for power. 
Already, high prices for natural gas and electricity have created incentives 
for producers to boost supplies. And the stodgy local monopolies that once 
dominated the industry must now reckon with a bevy of independent producers, 
distributors and traders. Even telecom companies are now considered fair 
game, offering managers of sector funds fresh choices alongside greater risk. 
""The classification of a utility has changed,"" Beckwith says. 
At the same time, the crisis gripping electricity-starved California is 
showing other states the pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids. 
""The outlook for wiser deregulation is very much with us,"" says Bill Reaves, 
a manager of the Strong American Utilities fund (SAMUX). The crisis out west 
has also spurred construction of new power plants from New York to Florida, 
he adds. Managers also count on continued political support from the former 
oilmen in the White House who are determined to boost domestic output. 
With such inducements in mind, we screened Morningstar's database looking for 
no-load utilities portfolios with one-year returns of at least 1% and 
three-year annualized returns of 5% or more. We also sought funds with 
initial investment minimums no higher than $3,000 and expense ratios below 
the category's average. 
Strong American Utilities 
Bill Reaves, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities fund, characterizes 
the $290 million portfolio's positions as ""real utilities."" 
""We try to concentrate in the electric and natural-gas area,"" Reaves says. 
""We try to concentrate in holdings and companies where we see good growth."" 
Last year, that meant scaling back significantly from telecom stocks, in part 
because of a deteriorating outlook. 
Right now, electric utilities represent 44.5% of the fund - and Dominion 
Resources (D) is the largest position. Energy ranging from gas utilities to 
integrated oil and gas companies has also been a significant holding, at 
24.2%. 
Reaves and the rest of the portfolio management team are also very sensitive 
to valuations. The portfolio consists of 40 stocks, but the managers can 
devote up to 75% of the fund's assets to the 16 to 18 companies seen as the 
best bargains. 
This cautious approach has stood the fund well at a time when some of its 
competitors got hit by telecoms' travails. The Strong portfolio rose 27.33% 
in 2000 and is up 2.42% so far this year, contributing to a 15.18% three-year 
record. 
Reaves expects the good times to last, with industry earnings growth on the 
order of 8% to 10% coupled with dividends of about 5% over the next three to 
five years. ""Demand is likely to keep on being strong...and the value of the 
service is going to be appreciated a great deal more,"" Reaves says. For 
example, the electric utilities' average price-to-earnings ratio for 2002 is 
about 12 - roughly a 50% discount to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
The minimum investment is $2,500, and the portfolio bears a 1% expense ratio. 
Vanguard Utilities Income 
""We won't be moving with the Nasdaq,"" says portfolio manager Beckwith of the 
Vanguard Utilities Income fund he runs. Beckwith invests a relatively small 
17% slice of the $900 million fund in telecom stocks. As with the other funds 
in this screen, such caution paid off last year, when the fund gained 18.7%. 
That turned the tables on 1999, when the technology boom consigned Vanguard 
Utilities to the rear echelon of its peer group. Annualized over three years, 
the portfolio has returned 9.33%, trailing the average utilities' fund's 
10.53%. 
Here, too, the emphasis is on attractive valuations. Beckwith also has a 
mandate to invest at least 95% of the portfolio in dividend-paying utilities 
(last year, all assets had to be invested in such stocks.) ""I'm going to get 
as much growth as I can without taking on too much risk,"" Beckwith says. 
Right now, Beckwith has 61% of his assets in defensive electric utilities 
such as Dominion Resources or the FPL Group (FPL). 
The portfolio is down 2.65% so far this year, but Beckwith, too, is counting 
on continued strong demand for electricity. ""Earnings momentum will be very 
good for the group at least over the next year,"" he says. His main concern is 
that high energy prices could encourage conservation, eventually depressing 
demand. 
The investment threshold is $3,000, and the expense ratio is a slim 0.38%. 
American Gas Index fund 
This concentrated portfolio rises and falls with the gas industry's 
prospects. Strong natural-gas prices boosted the American Gas Index fund's 
(GASFX) return last year to a 55.86%, far above the sector's average. That 
more than offset the 3.71% drop in 1999. Annualized over three years, the 
roughly $300 million fund has gained 15.82%. 
Like other index portfolios, the fund doesn't make stock picks; instead it 
owns 73 members of the American Gas Association, representing much of the gas 
distribution and transmission industry in most U.S. regions. Stocks are 
weighted by market-cap and by the portion of a company's assets involved in 
natural gas. Top holdings include Williams Companies (WMB), Enron (ENE) and 
Duke Energy (DUK). 
The initial investment is $2,500, and expenses are 0.85%.

Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute

Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute

     Kuala Lumpur, May 22 (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia LNG Tiga Sdn.
may have to find new buyers for as much as 2.6 million metric tons
a year of liquefied natural gas if Dabhol Power Co. carries
through termination of electricity supplies to India's Maharashtra
State Electricity Board.
     MLNG Tiga has an agreement to deliver a maximum 2.6 million
tons a year of LNG each year to an import terminal Enron is
building to feed the Dabhol power plant.
     Saturday, Dabhol Power, 65 percent owned by Enron Corp. of
the U.S., started a procedure to end its power supply contract to
the electricity board, its sole customer, which owes over 3
billion Indian rupees ($64 million) in unpaid power bills.
     ``It is our hope that matters in India would be resolved,''
said Azman Ibrahim, spokesman for state-owned Petroliam Nasional
Bhd., which owns 60 percent of MLNG Tiga. ``If they do not work
out, we would have to find or make alternative arrangements.''
     MLNG Tiga is constructing Malaysia's third gas export
facility, which will raise the country's LNG capacity to 23
million tons from about 16 million tons in 2000. If Dabhol goes
through with cancellation of its power supply contract, MLNG Tiga
would have to find buyers for more than a third of the 6.8 million
tons it is adding to Malaysia's output capacity.
     Other partners in MLNG Tiga are the Sarawak state government
with a 10 percent share, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's unit Shell Gas
BV with 15 percent, Nippon Oil LNG (Netherlands) BV with 10
percent and Diamond Gas Netherlands BV with 5 percent.
     The plant is due to be completed at the end of 2002 with
commercial production due to begin in 2003.
     India's federal and state governments may have to pay Dabhol
Power Co. more than 170 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) if the Enron
Corp. unit cancels its 2,184 megawatt power venture.



		

		
		
		
		LEADER: India unplugged 
Financial Times; May 22, 2001

		The latest threat from Enron, the US energy group, to pull out of its Dabhol 
power plant venture near Bombay illustrates both the shambolic nature of 
India's electricity system and the wider risks of investing in the country. 
The project had serious drawbacks. But unless energy companies can expect a 
commercial return, they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructure. 
Unless contracts are honoured, few foreign companies will consider India as a 
place to do business. 
		The Maharashtra state electricity board, the Dabhol plant's only customer, is 
refusing to pay its bills, arguing that the tariffs are unjustifiably 
inflated. Prices are certainly high. The plant, fuelled by expensive naphtha, 
is running way below capacity due to unexpectedly low demand, further 
increasing unit costs. More difficult to judge is whether this is within the 
terms of the contract, since Enron is keeping the details confidential. 
		The argument over unit costs, though, is in any case less relevant than it 
might seem as most of India's state electricity boards, including 
Maharashtra's, operate at a large loss. Many consumers pay highly subsidised 
rates. Many pay nothing. Bills go uncollected. Half of Delhi's electricity 
output is stolen, mostly to power middle-class air conditioners rather than 
light bulbs for the poor. Bankrupt state utilities are then periodically 
bailed out to the detriment of spending on health and education. 
		India's state authorities urgently need to introduce a common minimum tariff 
and a more targeted form of subsidy. This may be unpopular, but the central 
government's offer of Dollars 5.6bn, raised via a bond issue, to pay off the 
electricity boards' debts should sweeten the pill. 
		A new pricing regime is only the first step. Electricity generation, 
transmission and distribution should be unbundled and privatised. Contracts 
should be awarded through competition, not by arrangement with the relevant 
political party. This would require much more transparency than many of 
India's politicians have been ready to concede. 
		Enron's difficulties over the Dabhol plant, the largest foreign investment in 
India, have persuaded other western companies to withdraw from similar 
projects. This will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages 
that hinder economic development. But the effect will reverberate well beyond 
the energy sector. 
		India receives a pitifully small slice of the world's foreign direct 
investment. Infrastructure weaknesses are certainly one factor. But as 
important is the readiness of Indian politicians to manipulate foreign 
business for their own ends.

Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp. is pulling out of a large natural gas project off Qatar, the 
company said Monday. 
Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with 
Elf, a subsidiary of France's TotalFinaElf, and the United Arab Emirates 
Offsets Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North 
Field. 
More than a year ago those involved with the project said it could end up 
requiring investments of up to $10 billion over six or seven years. 
Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project 
to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news release it 
had started negotiating with other international players to become 
stakeholders. 
With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent 
of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released. 
Enron pulled out for a couple reasons, including that it believes there are 
better places to invest its money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in 
London. 
The project doesn't necessarily fit with Enron's current focus. 
It is emphasizing businesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale 
markets such as those for natural gas, electricity and broadband. 
Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates 
Offsets Group that were ""in line with our core business activities."" 
M. Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, said 
Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international assets 
that generate low returns.

Enron exploring commodity trading 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle News Services 
NEW YORK -- Houston-based Enron Corp., the nation's largest natural gas and 
electricity trading house, is looking to continue its expansion into 
industries beyond energy with a move into the cocoa, coffee and sugar 
businesses, industry sources said Monday. 
Enron has had conversations and interviews with members of the commodity 
trade in recent weeks, using a London-based recruitment firm to help them, 
the sources said. 
""They are definitely interested in getting into the business. Enron has been 
looking for physical traders. They have some internal people and are looking 
for lieutenants with experience,"" a cocoa trader said. 
A representative of Enron's public relations department would only say that 
the firm is constantly investigating different markets and opportunities. 
""There is always a lot of speculation about what we are doing,"" Habiba Bayi 
of Enron said Monday.

Carolyn and Cynthia,

       You should write this letter on your letter head and direct it to Joe
Jaso and copy Tom DeLay, Jim Ellis, and myself. All funds where money could
be left in the State of Texas from corporate and personal should be included.

Dear Joe:

       Enron, Mr. Ken Lay and Mr. Skilling are requesting that their
contribution be matched per our understanding from the fax and verbal
communications from Warren RoBold. This totals $100,000 between both
individuals and the Corporation for the RNSEC matching funds program. We want
these funds matched in time for the Texas State deadlines. It was our
intention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to this
account. The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minor
confusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC. This is very important to
Mr. Lay and Mr. Shilling.
        Let us know if we need to request these funds returned and new checks
written and mailed to you at your DC address. You may call me if you have any
questions.

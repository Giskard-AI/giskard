# üó£Ô∏èTalk to your model

The **Talk to Your Model** feature allows you to engage in a *conversation* with your ML model. Using natural language, you can:

- Run model predictions.
- Obtain explanations for those predictions, gaining insights into the prediction logic.
- Get decision-making advice based on the prediction.

## Making predictions

To talk to your model, you simply need [to wrap it with giskard](../wrap_model/index.md) and call the `talk` method:

```python
import giskard
import os

# Running this with our demo model and dataset for Titanic survival prediction
model, df = giskard.demo.titanic()
giskard_dataset = giskard.Dataset(df=df, target="Survived", name="Titanic dataset")
giskard_model = giskard.Model(model=model, model_type="classification",
                              name="Titanic model that returns yes if survived otherwise no",
                              classification_labels=["no", "yes"])

# Set your OpenAI API key, by default we are using GPT 3.5
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-...'

# Talk to your model
print(giskard_model.talk('What is this model doing?'))
# -> This model is a Titanic model that returns yes or no if the passenger survived.

print(giskard_model.talk('Can you tell me if "Webber, Miss. Susan" survived the titanic crash?', giskard_dataset, True))
# -> Yes, "Webber, Miss. Susan" survived the titanic crash.


print(giskard_model.talk('Can you explain to me why you predicted that "Webber, Miss. Susan" survived the titanic crash? Which feature was important?', giskard_dataset, True))
# -> The model predicted that "Webber, Miss. Susan" survived the titanic crash because the feature 'Sex' had the highest weight in the prediction with a value of 0.5146240790230515.
```

## Asking questions about reliability

To ask questions about the model's reliability, you can provide results from the Giskard scan to the `talk` method:

```python
import giskard
import os

# Running this with our demo model and dataset for Titanic survival prediction
model, df = giskard.demo.titanic()
giskard_dataset = giskard.Dataset(df=df, target="Survived", name="Titanic dataset")
giskard_model = giskard.Model(model=model, model_type="classification",
                              name="Titanic model that return yes if survived otherwise no",
                              classification_labels=['no', 'yes'])

# Scan your model
scan_report = giskard.scan(giskard_model, giskard_dataset)

# Set up your OpenAI API key, by default we are using GPT 3.5
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-...'

# Talk to your model
print(giskard_model.talk("Is this model reliable?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> The model is not reliable.

print(giskard_model.talk("Can I trust this model?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> No, this model is not reliable due to its vulnerabilities and overconfidence issues.

print(giskard_model.talk("What are the risks of this model?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> The risks of this model include performance issues, robustness issues, overconfidence issues, and spurious correlations. Performance issues include lower than expected recall for records where `Name` contains "mr", `Sex` == "male", `Pclass` == 3, `Name` contains "master", `Embarked` == "S", `Pclass` == 1, `Name` contains "miss", and `Embarked` == "Q". Robustness issues include a fail rate of 0.067 when perturbing the content of feature ‚ÄúName‚Äù with the transformation ‚ÄúTransform to title case‚Äù. Overconfidence issues include higher than expected overconfidence rate for records where `Name` contains "mr", `text_length(Name)` < 28.500, `Fare` < 14.850, `Sex` == "male", `avg_word_length(Name)` < 6.292, `Parch` < 0.500, and `avg_whitespace(Name)` >= 0.106. Spurious correlations include a high nominal association (Theil's U) for records where `Sex` == "female

print(giskard_model.talk("How good is the quality of this model?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> The model is not reliable and has several vulnerabilities.

print(giskard_model.talk("Was this model well built?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> No, this model was not well built as it has several vulnerabilities and reliability issues.

print(giskard_model.talk("Are there any vulnerabilities in this model?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> Yes, there are some vulnerabilities in this model.

print(giskard_model.talk("What are the vulnerabilities of this model?", scan_report=scan_report))
# -> The vulnerabilities of the model are: \n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Name` contains "mr"\', metric=\'Recall\', metric_delta=-96.85%>: 264 samples (59.19%)\n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Sex` == "male"\', metric=\'Recall\', metric_delta=-83.19%>: 296 samples (66.37%)\n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Pclass` == 3\', metric=\'Precision\', metric_delta=-36.89%>: 247 samples (55.38%)\n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Name` contains "master"\', metric=\'Accuracy\', metric_delta=-10.00%>: 24 samples (5.38%)\n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Embarked` == "S"\', metric=\'Recall\', metric_delta=-7.52%>: 317 samples (71.08%)\n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Pclass` == 1\', metric=\'Accuracy\', metric_delta=-6.82%>: 105 samples (23.54%)\n<PerformanceIssue slice=\'`Name` contains "miss"\', metric=\'Accuracy\', metric

```

## Go from simple predictions to decision-making

```python
import giskard
import os

# Running this with our demo model and dataset for Titanic survival prediction
model, df = giskard.demo.titanic()
giskard_dataset = giskard.Dataset(df=df, target="Survived", name="Titanic dataset")
giskard_model = giskard.Model(model=model, model_type="classification",
                              name="Titanic model that returns yes if survived otherwise no",
                              classification_labels=["no", "yes"])

# Set your OpenAI API key, by default we are using GPT 3.5
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-...'

# Talk to your model
print(giskard_model.talk("I'm making a movie about the Titanic. What characteristics should the main character possess to ensure their survival?"))
# -> The main character should possess the characteristics of a female, aged 32.5, with a passenger class of 2, no siblings or parents, and a fare of 13.0. These characteristics would ensure their survival.
```

## Use a custom language model

By default, GPT 3.5 will be used to generate responses. You can make use of
your preferred [large language model](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/) by setting the default llm globally
using `giskard.set_default_llm`:

```python
import giskard
from langchain.llms import Cohere

# Create your llm
llm = Cohere()

# Set your llm globally
giskard.llm_config.set_default_llm(llm)
```

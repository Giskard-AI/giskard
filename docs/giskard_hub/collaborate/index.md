# 🤝 Collaborate to Build Better Models

Collaboration is important in AI QA for various reasons:
* **Alignment Between Stakeholders**: If your quality criteria are very specific to your business, you will need to engage in some discussions before defining tests, evaluation criteria, or data slices.
* **Accountability Among Stakeholders**: Have your tests and issues reviewed by different stakeholders to share responsibility across the team.

With Giskard, you can:
* Easily **invite** business experts with domain knowledge to debug your issues.
* **Collect feedback** from other team members on your issues.
* **Discuss** quality issues with various stakeholders.
* **Integrate** your discussions into your favorite communication channels (such as Slack, email, etc.).

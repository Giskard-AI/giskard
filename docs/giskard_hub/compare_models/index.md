# ⚖️ Compare models

Comparing different models enables you to:
* At prototyping time, **choose the best model** among various candidates with different LLM prompts, LLM providers, hyperparameters, etc.
* At production time, decide whether to **promote** a new model version over the running model in production.

Building a great test suite is key to being able to compare models. With Giskard, you can:
* Run the same test suite for different **models**: this is useful for comparing different models.
* Run the same test suite for different **datasets**: this is useful for monitoring your model with different batches of examples.

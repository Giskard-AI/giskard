# Azure

Installing Giskard in Azure enables you to inspect & test models that you created in the Microsoft Azure environment (ex: Azure Machine Learning, Synapse Analytics, etc.). Here are the 3 steps to install Giskard in a new VM instance in Azure:

## 1. Create a Giskard VM Instance in Azure

1. Select "Create a resource" and choose Virtual Machine
2. In the configuration of your VM, select the default configuration:
    1. Choose a Linux machine. For instance, it can be the default `Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS`
    2. We recommend you choose at least the `Standard_D2s` machine (2vCPU, 8GB memory)
    3. Enable the default SSH connection by selecting `Inbound ports: SSH (22)`
3. Create your VM instance. Make sure you downloaded the certificate file containing the private key you will need to SSH
4. On the home page, select the VM you just created by selecting `Go to Resource`
5. Go to `Settings`, `Networking`, and click on `Add inbound port rule` with the following properties:

6. Connect to your VM in SSH by using the path of the **private key file** you downloaded. To do so, go to the tab `Overview`, select `Connect` and `SSH` then follow the different steps to get the right command to execute in your terminal.&#x20;

:::{note}
For example, the terminal command line to SSH connect to your install from your computer can be:

```
sudo ssh -i /Users/bob/Downloads/Giskard2_key.cer azureuser@52.142.236.215
```

## 2. Install Giskard in the VM

* Installation of the Giskard requirements (`git` and `docker`)

```bash
 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
 sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

* Installation of Giskard

```bash
giskard hub start
```

## 3. Connect to your instance

* Get the Public IP address of your Giskard VM by clicking on the `Overview` tab
* Go to **`http://<your IP address>:19000`** in your web browser

:::{note}
You can stop the instance and restart it when you need to save your Azure compute costs. However, note that&#x20;

* the **IP address will not necessarily be the same**. So make sure you copy it again when it's launched.
* you will need to **re-start the Giskard hub**, by executing in the Giskard folder:

&#x20;`giskard hub start`
:::

* The user id is `admin` and the password is `admin`

## 4. Start the ML worker

Giskard executes your model using an ML worker that runs the model. The worker is created along with your project, using the dependencies in your current environment. You can start the worker on Giskard Hub, if it is not started automatically.

For advanced and flexible usages, please check [our doc for ML worker](../../mlworker/index.md).

You're all set to try Giskard in action. Upload your first model, dataset or test suite by following the [upload an object](../../../upload/index.md) page.

# Azure

Installing Giskard in Azure enables you to inspect & test models that you created in the Microsoft Azure environment (ex: Azure Machine Learning, Synapse Analytics, etc.). Here are the 3 steps to install Giskard in a new VM instance in Azure:

## 1. Create a Giskard VM Instance in Azure

1. Select "Create a resource" and choose Virtual Machine
2. In the configuration of your VM, select the default configuration:
    1. Choose a Linux machine. For instance, it can be the default `Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS`
    2. We recommend you choose at least the `Standard_D2s` machine (2vCPU, 8GB memory)
    3. Enable the default SSH connection by selecting `Inbound ports: SSH (22)`
3. Create your VM instance. Make sure you downloaded the certificate file containing the private key you will need to SSH
4. On the home page, select the VM you just created by selecting `Go to Resource`
5. Go to `Settings`, `Networking`, and click on `Add inbound port rule` with the following properties:

6. Connect to your VM in SSH by using the path of the **private key file** you downloaded. To do so, go to the tab `Overview`, select `Connect` and `SSH` then follow the different steps to get the right command to execute in your terminal.&#x20;

:::{note}
For example, the terminal command line to SSH connect to your install from your computer can be:

```
sudo ssh -i /Users/bob/Downloads/Giskard2_key.cer azureuser@52.142.236.215
```

## 2. Install Giskard in the VM

* Installation of the Giskard requirements (`git` and `docker`)

```bash
 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
 sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

* Installation of Giskard

```bash
giskard hub start
```

## 3. Connect to your instance

* Get the Public IP address of your Giskard VM by clicking on the `Overview` tab
* Go to **`http://<your IP address>:19000`** in your web browser

:::{note}
You can stop the instance and restart it when you need to save your Azure compute costs. However, note that&#x20;

* the **IP address will not necessarily be the same**. So make sure you copy it again when it's launched.
* you will need to **re-start the Giskard hub**, by executing in the Giskard folder:

&#x20;`giskard hub start`
:::

* The user id is `admin` and the password is `admin`

## 4. Start the ML worker

Giskard executes your model using a worker that runs the model directly in **your Python environment**, with all the dependencies required by your model. You can either execute the ML worker:

- From your **local notebook** within the kernel that contains all the dependencies of your model
- From **Google Colab** within the kernel that contains all the dependencies of your model
- Or from **your terminal** within the Python environment that contains all the dependencies of your model

:::{note}
If you plan to use LLM-assisted tests or transformations, don’t forget to set the ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` environment
variable before starting the Giskard worker.

:::::::{tab-set}
::::::{tab-item} From your local notebook

To start the ML worker from your notebook, run the following code in your notebook:

```
!giskard worker start -d -k YOUR_KEY -u http://<your IP address>:19000/
```

The API Access Key (`YOUR_KEY`) can be found in the Settings tab of the Giskard Hub.


> ### ⚠️ Warning
> To see the available commands of the worker, you can execute:
>```
>!giskard worker --help

You're all set to try Giskard in action. Upload your first model, dataset or test suite by following the [upload an object](../../../upload/index.md) page.

::::::
::::::{tab-item} From Colab notebook

To start the ML worker from your Colab notebook, run in your Colab cell:

```
!giskard worker start -d -k YOUR_KEY -u http://<your IP address>:19000/
```
The API Access Key (`YOUR_KEY`) can be found in the Settings tab of the Giskard Hub.

> ### ⚠️ Warning
> To see the available commands of the worker, you can execute:
>```
>!giskard worker --help

::::::{tab-item} From your terminal

* Run the following command **within the Python environment that contains all the dependencies of your model**:

```
giskard worker start -k YOUR_KEY -u http://<your IP address>:19000/
```
The API Access Key (`YOUR_KEY`) can be found in the Settings tab of the Giskard Hub.

> ### ⚠️ Warning

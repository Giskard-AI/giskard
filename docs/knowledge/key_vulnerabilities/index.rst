ML Model Vulnerabilities
===================

Before testing Machine Learning models, it's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the critical vulnerabilities that can impact your model. Giskard provides an `automatic scan functionality <../../open_source/scan/index.md>`_ that is designed to automatically detect a variety of risks associated with your ML model. You can learn more about the different vulnerabilities it can detect here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   performance_bias/index
   robustness/index
   overconfidence/index
   underconfidence/index
   ethics/index
   data_leakage/index
   stochasticity/index
   spurious/index

By conducting a `Giskard scan <../../open_source/scan/index.md>`_, you can proactively identify and address these vulnerabilities to ensure the reliability, fairness, and robustness of your Machine Learning models.

    "# LLM product description from keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Giskard is an open-source framework for testing all ML models, from LLMs to tabular models. Don’t hesitate to give the project a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/Giskard-AI/giskard) ⭐️ if you find it useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you’ll learn how to create comprehensive test suites for your model in a few lines of code, thanks to Giskard’s open-source Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we illustrate the procedure using **OpenAI Client** that is the default one; however, please note that our platform supports a variety of language models. For details on configuring different models, visit our [🤖 Setting up the LLM Client page](../../open_source/setting_up/index.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will walk through a practical use case of using the Giskard LLM Scan on a Prompt Chaining task, one step at a time. Given a product name, we will ask the LLM to process 2 chained prompts using `langchain` in order to provide us with a product description. The 2 prompts can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `keywords_prompt_template`: Based on the product name (given by the user), the LLM has to provide a list of five to ten relevant keywords that would increase product visibility.\n",
    "2. `product_prompt_template`: Based on the given keywords (given as a response to the first prompt), the LLM has to generate a multi-paragraph rich text product description with emojis that is creative and SEO compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use-case:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Two-step product description generation. 1) Keywords generation -> 2) Description generation;\n",
    "* Foundational model: *gpt-3.5-turbo*\n",
    "\n",
    "Outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect vulnerabilities automatically with Giskard's scan\n",
    "* Automatically generate & curate a comprehensive test suite to test your model beyond accuracy-related metrics"

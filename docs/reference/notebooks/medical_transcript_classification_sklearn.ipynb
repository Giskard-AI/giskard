Following his amputation, he had poor wound healing.  He presented to the ED with pain in his right lower extremity on July 9, 2008.  Due to concern for infection at that time, he was started on oral Keflex and instructed to follow up with the Vascular Clinic as scheduled.  At his follow-up appointment, it was decided to re-admit The patient for debridement and revision of his stump wound.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Briefly, The patient underwent extensive debridement of his right below-knee amputation wound on July 17, 2008.  He underwent debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone to remove the necrotic tissue from the stump.  A wound VAC. was also placed to help accelerate wound healing.  The patient&#x27;s postoperative course was complicated initially by acute blood-loss anemia, requiring blood transfusion.  He returned to the OR on Monday, July 21, 2008 for irrigation and debridement of his right below-knee amputation and a wound VAC change.  Again, on July 24, 2008, and then again on July 28, 2008, The patient returned to the operating room for irrigation and debridement of his wound and wound VAC change.  Following his procedure on July 28, 2008, The patient began having recurrent episodes of diarrhea, prompting stool cultures and C. difficile assay to be sent.  He was also started on Flagyl, empirically.  C. difficile assay returned positive and the decision was made to continue Flagyl for a full 14-day course.  On July 31, 2008, the patient began experiencing shortness of breath and wheezing after standing to be weighed.  His vital signs remained stable.  However, his oxygen saturation dropped to 93%, improving only to 97% after an addition of 2 liters by nasal cannula.  A chest x-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis in addition to some pulmonary edema diffusely.  The patient&#x27;s IV fluids were decreased.  He was given p.r.n. albuterol and infusion of Lasix, resulting in significant urine output.  His symptoms of shortness of breath gradually improved.  On August 1, 2008, he returned to the OR for final irrigation and debridement of his below-knee amputation.  Again, a wound VAC was placed.  Postoperatively, he did well.  His Foley catheter was removed.  His vital signs remained stable, and his respiratory status also remained stable.  Arrangements were made for home health and wound VAC care upon discharge.,DISCHARGE CONDITION: , The patient is resting comfortably.  He denies shortness of breath or chest pain.

       "      &lt;td&gt;HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&amp;amp;P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN: , My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.,&lt;/td&gt;\n",

The patient has been using saline nasal wash 2-3 times daily, however, she states that she still has discomfort in her nose with a &quot;stretching&quot; like pressure.  She says her nose is frequently dry and she occasionally has nosebleeds due to the dry nature of her nose.  She has no other complaints at this time.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,GENERAL:  This is a pleasant African-American female resting in the examination room chair in no apparent distress.,ENT:  External auditory canals are clear.  Tympanic membrane shows no perforation, is intact.,NOSE:  The patient has a slightly deviated right septum.  Septum has a large perforation in the anterior 2/3rd of the septum.  This appears to be well healed.  There is no sign of crusting in the nose.,ORAL CAVITY:  No lesions or sores.  Tonsils show no exudate or erythema.,NECK:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 77, respirations 18, blood pressure 130/73.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 40-year-old female with a past medical history of repair of deviated septum with complication of a septal perforation.  At this time, the patient states that her septal perforation bothers her as she feels that she has very dry air through her nose as well as occasional epistaxis.  At this time, I counseled the patient on the risks and benefits of surgery.  She will consider surgery but at this time, would like to continue using the saline nasal wash as well as occasional Bactroban to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting, which she will apply with the edge of a Q-tip.  We will see her back in 3 weeks and if the patient does not feel relieved from the Bactroban as well as saline nasal spray wash, we will consider setting the patient for surgery at that time.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

We have done EMG studies.  He has noticed it since his stroke about five years ago.  He has been to see a neurologist.  We have tried different medications and it just does not seem to help.  He checks his blood sugars at home two to three times a day.  He kind of adjusts his own insulin himself.  Re-evaluation of symptoms is essentially negative.

She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.

He was recently hospitalized for left gluteal abscess, for which he underwent I&amp;amp;D and he has newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.  He also has a history of hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia.  He had been having increased urination and thirst.  He was seen in the hospital by the endocrinology staff and treated with insulin while hospitalized and getting treatment for his perirectal abscess.  The endocrine team apparently felt that insulin might be best for this patient, but because of financial issues, elected to place him on Glucophage and glyburide.  The patient reports that he has been taking the medication.  He is in general feeling better.  He says that his gluteal abscess is improving and he will be following up with Surgery today.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Gabapentin 600 mg at night.,2.  Metformin 1000 mg twice a day.,3.

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Followup cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.  I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Afebrile to touch.,She ambulates with a normal gait.,Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.,Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus.  Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.,Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Patellar reflex is 3 plus.  No clonus.,Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.,They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease.  There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC&#x27;s history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient&#x27;s relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.  Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.  She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Followup cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.  I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Afebrile to touch.,She ambulates with a normal gait.,Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.,Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus.  Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.,Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Patellar reflex is 3 plus.  No clonus.,Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.,They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease.  There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC&#x27;s history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient&#x27;s relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.  Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.  She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

History of GI bleed in 1995.,4.  History of depression.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a return visit to the renal clinic for this patient.  She is an 85-year-old woman with history as noted above.  Her last visit was approximately four months ago.  Since that time, the patient has been considerably more compliant with her antihypertensive medications and actually had a better blood pressure reading today than she had had for many visits previously.  She is not reporting any untoward side effect.  She is not having weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  She has no orthopnea.  Her exercise capacity is about the same.  The only problem she has is musculoskeletal and that pain in the right buttock, she thinks originating from her spine.  No history of extremity pain.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg.,2.  Norvasc 10 mg daily.,3.  Atenolol 50 mg a day.,4.  Atacand 32 mg a day.,5.  Cardura 4 mg a day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.2, pulse 47, respirations 16, and blood pressure 157/56.  THORAX:  Revealed lungs that are clear, PA and lateral without adventitious sounds.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 without murmur.  No S3.  I could not hear murmur today.  ABDOMEN:  Above plane, but nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Revealed no edema.,ASSESSMENT:,  This is a return visit for this patient who has refractory hypertension.  This seems to be doing very well given her current blood pressure reading, at least much improved from what she had been previously.  We had discussed with her in the past beginning to see an internist at the senior center.  She apparently had an appointment scheduled and it was missed.  We are going to reschedule that today given her overall state of well-being and the fact that she has no evidence of GFR that is greater than 60%.,PLAN: , The plan will be for her to follow up at the senior center for her routine health care, and should the need arise for further management of blood pressure, a referral back to us.  In the meantime, we will discharge her from our practice.  Should there be confusion or difficulty getting in the senior center, we can always see her back in followup&lt;/td&gt;\n",

She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Total abdominal hysterectomy.,2.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy.,3.  Repair of bladder laceration.,4.  Appendectomy.,5.  Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy.,6.  Posterior colpoperineoplasty.,GROSS FINDINGS:  The patient had a history of a rapidly growing mass on the abdomen, extending from the pelvis over the past two to three months.  She had a recent D&amp;amp;C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.  The vaginal vault was packed with a Betadine-soaked Kling gauze sponge.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

The patient has been using saline nasal wash 2-3 times daily, however, she states that she still has discomfort in her nose with a &quot;stretching&quot; like pressure.  She says her nose is frequently dry and she occasionally has nosebleeds due to the dry nature of her nose.  She has no other complaints at this time.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,GENERAL:  This is a pleasant African-American female resting in the examination room chair in no apparent distress.,ENT:  External auditory canals are clear.  Tympanic membrane shows no perforation, is intact.,NOSE:  The patient has a slightly deviated right septum.  Septum has a large perforation in the anterior 2/3rd of the septum.  This appears to be well healed.  There is no sign of crusting in the nose.,ORAL CAVITY:  No lesions or sores.  Tonsils show no exudate or erythema.,NECK:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 77, respirations 18, blood pressure 130/73.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 40-year-old female with a past medical history of repair of deviated septum with complication of a septal perforation.  At this time, the patient states that her septal perforation bothers her as she feels that she has very dry air through her nose as well as occasional epistaxis.  At this time, I counseled the patient on the risks and benefits of surgery.  She will consider surgery but at this time, would like to continue using the saline nasal wash as well as occasional Bactroban to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting, which she will apply with the edge of a Q-tip.  We will see her back in 3 weeks and if the patient does not feel relieved from the Bactroban as well as saline nasal spray wash, we will consider setting the patient for surgery at that time.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Total abdominal hysterectomy.,2.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy.,3.  Repair of bladder laceration.,4.  Appendectomy.,5.  Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy.,6.  Posterior colpoperineoplasty.,GROSS FINDINGS:  The patient had a history of a rapidly growing mass on the abdomen, extending from the pelvis over the past two to three months.  She had a recent D&amp;amp;C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.  The vaginal vault was packed with a Betadine-soaked Kling gauze sponge.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

       "      &lt;td&gt;PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Brain tumors, multiple.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Brain tumors multiple - adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast.,PROCEDURE:,  Occipital craniotomy, removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach, stealth system operating microscope and CUSA.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  The bone flap was elevated.  The ultrasound was then used.  The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  We obtained access to the tumor.  We biopsied this and submitted it.  This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.,Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total.  After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery.  The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates.  The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle.  This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage.  The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.  The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.  The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.  The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.,Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.  The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

Total abdominal hysterectomy.,2.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy.,3.  Repair of bladder laceration.,4.  Appendectomy.,5.  Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy.,6.  Posterior colpoperineoplasty.,GROSS FINDINGS:  The patient had a history of a rapidly growing mass on the abdomen, extending from the pelvis over the past two to three months.  She had a recent D&amp;amp;C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.  The vaginal vault was packed with a Betadine-soaked Kling gauze sponge.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.  She does take her low-dose aspirin daily as well as her multivitamin.  She does wear her seatbelt.  As previously noted, she does not smoke or drink alcohol.,PAST MEDICAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Per health summary sheet, unchanged.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Unremarkable with the exception of that above. ,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Benicar 20 mg daily; multivitamin; glucosamine; vitamin B complex; vitamin E and a low-dose aspirin.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  Well-nourished, well-developed, a very pleasant 61-year-old in no acute distress.,Vitals:  Her weight today is 246 pounds.  In March of 2002 she weighed 231 pounds.  In March 2001 she weighed 203 pounds.  Her blood pressure is 160/78.  Pulse is 84.  Respiratory rate of 20.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Head is of normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERLA.  Conjunctivae clear.  TMs are unremarkable and canals are patent.  Nasal mucosa is slightly reddened.  Nares are patent.  Throat shows some clear posterior pharyngeal drainage.  Throat is slightly reddened.  Non-exudative.  No oral lesions or dental caries noted.,Neck:  Supple, No adenopathy.  Thyroid without any nodules or enlargements, no JVD or carotid bruits.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, clicks or rubs.  PMI is nondisplaced.,Lungs:  Clear to A&amp;amp;P.  No CVA tenderness.,Breast exam:  Negative for any axillary nodes, skin changes, discrete nodules or nipple discharge.  Breasts were examined both lying and sitting.,Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Non tender.,Pelvic exam:  BUS unremarkable.  Speculum exam shows normal physiologic discharge.  There are some atrophic vaginal changes.  Cervix visualized, no gross abnormalities.  Pap smear obtained.  Bimanual is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  Rectal exam is negative for any adnexal masses or tenderness.  No rectal masses.  She does have some external hemorrhoids, none of which are inflamed at this time.  No palpable rectal masses.,Neuromusculoskeletal exam:  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No cerebellar signs are noted.  No evidence of a gait disturbance.  DTRs are 1+/4+ and equal throughout.  Good uptoeing.  Skin:  Inspection of her skin, subcuticular tissues negative for any concerning skin lesions, rashes or subcuticular masses.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Weight-gain.,2.  Hypertension.,3.  Lipometabolism disorder.,4.  Rectal bleeding.,5.  Left knee pain.,6.  Question of sleep apnea.,7.  Upper respiratory infection, improving.,8.  Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.  I do not recommend one this year.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

He was recently hospitalized for left gluteal abscess, for which he underwent I&amp;amp;D and he has newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.  He also has a history of hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia.  He had been having increased urination and thirst.  He was seen in the hospital by the endocrinology staff and treated with insulin while hospitalized and getting treatment for his perirectal abscess.  The endocrine team apparently felt that insulin might be best for this patient, but because of financial issues, elected to place him on Glucophage and glyburide.  The patient reports that he has been taking the medication.  He is in general feeling better.  He says that his gluteal abscess is improving and he will be following up with Surgery today.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Gabapentin 600 mg at night.,2.  Metformin 1000 mg twice a day.,3.  Glipizide 5 mg a day.,4.  Flagyl 500 mg four times a day.,5.  Flexeril 10 mg twice a day.,6.  Paroxetine 20 mg a day.,7.  Atripla one at night.,8.  Clonazepam 1 mg twice a day.,9.

Moderate stenosis C5-6.,OPERATION: , On 06/25/07, anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 using Bengal cages and Slimlock plate C4 to C7; intraoperative x-ray.,This is a 60-year-old white male who was in the office on 05/01/07 because of neck pain with left radiculopathy and &quot;tension headaches.&quot;  In the last year or so, he has had more and more difficulty and more recently has developed tingling and numbness into the fingers of the left hand greater than right.  He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful.  More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief.,Cervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7.  In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief.  The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Following admission, the procedure was carried out without difficulty.  Blood loss was about 125 cc.  Postop x-ray showed good alignment and positioning of the cages, plate, and screws.  After surgery, he was able to slowly increase his activity level with assistance from physical therapy.  He had some muscle spasm and soreness between the shoulder blades and into the back part of his neck.  He also had some nausea with the PCA.  He had a low-grade fever to 100.2 and was started on incentive spirometry.  Over the next 12 hours, his fever resolved and he was able to start getting up and around much more easily.,By 06/27/07, he was ready to go home.  He has been counseled regarding wound care and has received a neck sheet for instruction.  He will be seen in two weeks for wound check and for a followup evaluation/x-rays in about six weeks.  He has prescriptions for Lortab 7.5 mg and Robaxin 750 mg.  He is to call if there are any problems.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

She will consider surgery but at this time, would like to continue using the saline nasal wash as well as occasional Bactroban to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting, which she will apply with the edge of a Q-tip.  We will see her back in 3 weeks and if the patient does not feel relieved from the Bactroban as well as saline nasal spray wash, we will consider setting the patient for surgery at that time.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Afebrile to touch.,She ambulates with a normal gait.,Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.,Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus.  Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.,Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Patellar reflex is 3 plus.  No clonus.,Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.,They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease.  There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC&#x27;s history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient&#x27;s relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.  Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.  She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Septal irritation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 39-year-old African-American female status post repair of septal deviation but unfortunately, ultimately ended with a large septal perforation.  The patient has been using saline nasal wash 2-3 times daily, however, she states that she still has discomfort in her nose with a &quot;stretching&quot; like pressure.  She says her nose is frequently dry and she occasionally has nosebleeds due to the dry nature of her nose.  She has no other complaints at this time.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,GENERAL:  This is a pleasant African-American female resting in the examination room chair in no apparent distress.,ENT:  External auditory canals are clear.  Tympanic membrane shows no perforation, is intact.,NOSE:  The patient has a slightly deviated right septum.  Septum has a large perforation in the anterior 2/3rd of the septum.  This appears to be well healed.  There is no sign of crusting in the nose.,ORAL CAVITY:  No lesions or sores.  Tonsils show no exudate or erythema.,NECK:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 77, respirations 18, blood pressure 130/73.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 40-year-old female with a past medical history of repair of deviated septum with complication of a septal perforation.  At this time, the patient states that her septal perforation bothers her as she feels that she has very dry air through her nose as well as occasional epistaxis.  At this time, I counseled the patient on the risks and benefits of surgery.  She will consider surgery but at this time, would like to continue using the saline nasal wash as well as occasional Bactroban to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting, which she will apply with the edge of a Q-tip.  We will see her back in 3 weeks and if the patient does not feel relieved from the Bactroban as well as saline nasal spray wash, we will consider setting the patient for surgery at that time.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

He was recently hospitalized for left gluteal abscess, for which he underwent I&amp;amp;D and he has newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus.  He also has a history of hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia.  He had been having increased urination and thirst.  He was seen in the hospital by the endocrinology staff and treated with insulin while hospitalized and getting treatment for his perirectal abscess.  The endocrine team apparently felt that insulin might be best for this patient, but because of financial issues, elected to place him on Glucophage and glyburide.  The patient reports that he has been taking the medication.  He is in general feeling better.  He says that his gluteal abscess is improving and he will be following up with Surgery today.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,1.  Gabapentin 600 mg at night.,2.  Metformin 1000 mg twice a day.,3.

At that time, she was diagnosed with CIN 3 as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.  She underwent a cone biopsy that per her report was negative for any pathology.  She had no vulvar treatment at that time.  Since that time, she has had normal Pap smears.  She denies abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pain.  She uses Yaz for birth control.  She reports one sexual partner since 1994 and she is a nonsmoker.,She states that she has a tendency to have yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis.  She is also being evaluated for a possible interstitial cystitis because she gets frequent urinary tract infections.  She had a normal mammogram done in August 2006 and a history of perirectal condyloma that have been treated by Dr. B.  She also has a history of chlamydia when she was in college.,PAST MEDICAL HX: , Depression.,PAST SURGICAL HX: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Lexapro 10 mg a day and Yaz.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,OB HX: , Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at term in 2001 and 2004, Abc weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces and Xyz weighed 10 pounds 5 ounces.,FAMILY HX:  ,Maternal grandfather who had a MI which she reports is secondary to tobacco and alcohol use.  He currently has metastatic melanoma, mother with hypertension and depression, father with alcoholism.,SOCIAL HX:,  She is a public relations consultant.  She is a nonsmoker, drinks infrequent alcohol and does not use drugs.  She enjoys horseback riding and teaches jumping.,PE: , VITALS: Height: 5 feet 6 inches.  Weight: 139 lb.  BMI: 22.4.  Blood Pressure: 102/58.  GENERAL: She is well-developed and well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  She is alert and oriented to time, place, and person and her mood and affect is normal.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  BREASTS: Deferred.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Normal external female genitalia.  Vulva, vagina, and urethra, within normal limits.  Cervix is status post cone biopsy; however, the transformation zone grossly appears normal and cervical discharge is clear and normal in appearance.  GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.,Colposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.,A/P: , ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.,We will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.  We will check the results of the ECC.  She will return in two weeks for test results.  If these are normal, she will need two normal Pap smears six months apart, and I think followup colposcopy for the vulvar changes.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

The patient has no complaints.  She states she has been feeling well.  Her knees are not hurting her at all anymore and she is not needing Bextra any longer.  I think the last steroid injection that she had with Dr. XYZ really did help.  The patient denies any shortness of breath or cough.  Has no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  She states her appetite is good.  She clears her plate at noon.  She has had no fevers, chills, or sweats.  The friend with her states she is doing very well.  Seems to eat excellently at noontime, despite this, the patient continues to lose weight.  When I asked her what she eats for breakfast and for supper, she states she really does not eat anything.  Her only meal that she eats at the nursing home is the noon meal and then I just do not think she is eating much the rest of the time.  She states she is really not hungry the rest of the time except at lunchtime.  She denies any fevers, chills, or sweats.  We did do some lab work at the last office visit and CBC was essentially normal.  Comprehensive metabolic was essentially normal as was of the BUN of 32 and creatinine of 1.3.  This is fairly stable for her.  Liver enzymes were normal.  TSH was normal.  Free albumin was normal at 23.  She is on different antidepressants and that may be causing some difficulties with unintentional weight loss.,MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently are Aricept 10 mg a day, Prevacid 30 mg a day, Lexapro 10 mg a day, Norvasc 2.5 mg a day, Milk of Magnesia 30 cc daily, and Amanda 10 mg b.i.d.,ALLERGIES:,  No known drug allergies.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Reviewed from 05/10/2004 and unchanged other than the addition of paranoia, which is much improved on her current medications.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is widow.  She is a nonsmoker, nondrinker.  She lives at Kansas Christian Home independently, but actually does get a lot of help with medications, having a driver to bring her here, and going to the noon meal.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As above in HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,General:  This is a well-developed, pleasant Caucasian female, who appears thinner especially in her face.  States are clothes are fitting more loosely.,Vital Signs:  Weight:  123, down 5 pounds from last month and down 11 pounds from May 2004.  Blood pressure:  128/62.  Pulse:  60.  Respirations:  20.  Temperature:  96.8.,Neck:  Supple.  Carotids are silent.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft and nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  No organomegaly or masses are appreciated.,Extremities:  Free of edema.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Unintentional weight loss.  I think this is more a problem of just not getting in any calories though does not appear to be a medical problem go on, although her dementia may make it difficult for her to remember to eat, and with her antidepressant medication she is on, she just may not have much of an appetite to eat unless food is prepared for her.,2.  Depression, doing well.,3.  Paranoia, doing well.,4.  Dementia, stable.,5.  Osteoarthritis of the knees, pain is much improved.,PLAN:,1.  Continue on current medications.,2.  I did call and talk with doctor at hospital.  We discussed different options.  We have decided to have the patient eat the evening meal at the nursing home also and have her take a supplement drink such as Ensure at breakfast time.  Connie will weigh the patient once a week and I will go ahead and see the patient in one month.  We can see how she is doing at that time.  If she continues to lose weight despite eating better, then I think we will need to do further evaluation.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the &quot;bad crowd&quot; and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , The patient states that she feels better.  She is on IV amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the &quot;bad crowd&quot; and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.

Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

Insertion of epidural drain.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,200 cc.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 64-year-old female who has had an extensive medical history beginning with coronary artery bypass done on emergent basis while she was in Maryland in April of 2003 after having myocardial infarction.  She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today&#x27;s date, the health officer was notified of the patient&#x27;s labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient&#x27;s head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Not a very clear history at this time and the patient himself is not able to give any history despite no family member was present in the room.  Neurology consult was called to evaluate any organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma.  The patient since the morning has improved, but still not completely back to the baseline.

No discoloration of conjunctivae and the sclerae.,NECK:  Supple.  No signs of any meningismus.  Though a limited examination, the patient does appear to have arthritic changes, questioning contracture deformities, as not able to follow the commands to show full range of motion.  No bruit auscultated over the neck and the orbits.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.,HEART:  Normal heart sounds.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  No edema, clubbing or cyanosis.  No rash.  No leptomeningeal or neurocutaneous disorder.,NEUROLOGIC:  Examination is limited.  Mental state examination, the patient is awake, alert, and oriented to himself, not able follow commands, and give a proper history, and still appeared to be confuse and disoriented.  Cranial nerve examination limited, but apparently nonfocal.  Motor examination is very limited except for the grips, which were strong enough.  I was not able to obtain much.  Deep tendon reflexes were not reliable.  Toes equivocal and downgoing.  Sensory examination is not reliable, though intact for painful stimuli with limited examination.  Coordination could not be tested.  Gait could not be tested.,IMPRESSION:,  History of multiple myeloma and altered mental status in multiple myeloma setting.  Rule out brain metastasis including lepto-meningismus, possible transient ischemic attack related to hyperviscosity syndrome or provoked seizure related to ischemia, and delirium related to any electrolyte imbalance or underlying infarction.,PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient is to continue with current level of management.  I will review the chart before ordering any further testing that may include a CT scan of the brain, if has not been ordered, EEG, urine test, and the latest CBC with diff. to rule out any urinary tract infection or indication of any other seen of infection.  No other intervention at this time.  The patient may be started on aspirin, if it is okay with Dr. X.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.

       "      &lt;td&gt;SUBJECTIVE: , I am following the patient today for multiple issues.  He once again developed gross hematuria, which was unprovoked.  His Coumadin has been held.  The patient has known BPH and is on Flomax.  He is being treated with Coumadin because of atrial fibrillation and stroke.  This is the second time he has had significant gross hematuria this month.  He also fell about a week ago and is complaining of buttock pain and leg pain.  We did get x-rays of hips, knees, and ankles.  Clearly, he has significant degenerative disease in all these areas.  No fractures noted however.  He felt that the pain is pretty severe and particularly worse in the morning.  His sinuses are bothering him.  He wonders about getting some nasal saline spray.  We talked about Coumadin, stroke risk, etc. in the setting of atrial fibrillation.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  He is not in any apparent distress.  He is comfortable in a seated position.  I did not examine him further today.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,1.  Hematuria.  Coumadin needs to be stopped, so we will evaluate what is going on, which is probably just some BPH.  We will also obtain a repeat UA as he did describe to me some dysuria.  However, I do not think this would account for the gross hematuria.  He will be started on an aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.,2.  For the pain we will try him on Lortab.  He will get a Lortab everyday in the morning 5/500 prior to getting out of bed, and then he will have the option of having a few more throughout the day if he requires it.,3.  We will see about getting him set up with massage therapy and/or physical therapy as well for his back pain.,4.  For his sinuses, we will arrange for him to have saline nasal spray at the bedside for p.r.n. use.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

PELVIC: Normal external female genitalia.  Vulva, vagina, and urethra, within normal limits.  Cervix is status post cone biopsy; however, the transformation zone grossly appears normal and cervical discharge is clear and normal in appearance.  GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.,Colposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.,A/P: , ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.,We will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.

The patient underwent a 2-day induction.  On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress.  During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration.  Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication.  There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery.  It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay.  The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day.  The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.  It should be noted, however, that this was actually an expected result with the initial hematocrit of 32% preoperatively.  Therefore, there was anemia but not an unexplained anemia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: , Includes the stable vital signs, afebrile state.  An alert and oriented patient who is desirous at discharge.  Full range of motion, all extremities; fully ambulatory.  Pulse is regular and strong.  Lungs are clear and the abdomen is soft and nontender with minimal tympany and a nontender fundus.  The incision is beautiful and soft and nontender.  There is scant lochia and there is minimal edema.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Include hematocrit of 27% and the last liver function tests was within normal limits 48 hours prior to discharge.,FOLLOWUP: , For the patient includes pelvic rest, regular diet.  Follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks.  Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. cramps, Tylenol No.  3 one p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, prenatal vitamin one p.o. daily, and topical triple antibiotic to incision b.i.d. to q.i.d.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

This involved cough, post-tussive emesis, questionable fever, but only 99.7.  Their usual doctor prescribed amoxicillin over the phone.  The coughing persisted and worsened.  She went to the ER, where sats were normal at baseline, but dropped into the 80s with coughing spells.  They did witness some apnea.  They gave some Rocephin, did some labs, and the patient was transferred to hospital.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On admission, GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished baby in no apparent distress. HEENT:  There was some nasal discharge.  Remainder of the HEENT was normal.  LUNG:  Had few rhonchi.  No retractions.  No significant coughing or apnea during the admission physical.  ABDOMEN:  Benign.  EXTREMITIES:  Were without any cyanosis.,SIGNIFICANT LABS AND X-RAYS:  ,She had a CBC done Garberville, which showed a white count of 12.4, with a differential of 10 segs, 82 lymphs, 8 monos, hemoglobin of 15, hematocrit 42, platelets 296,000, and a normal BMP.  An x-ray was done and I do not have an official interpretation, but to the admitting physician, Dr. X it showed no significant infiltrate.  Well at hospital, she had a rapid influenza swab done, which was negative.  She had a rapid RSV done, which is still not in the chart, but I believe I was told that it was negative.  She also had a pertussis PCR swab done and a pertussis culture done, neither of which has result in the chart.  I do know that the pertussis culture proved to be negative.,CONSULTATION: , Public Health Department was notified of a case of suspected pertussis.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The baby was afebrile.  Required no oxygen in the hospital.  Actually fed reasonably well.  Did have one episode of coughing with slight emesis.  Appeared basically quite well between episodes.  Had no apnea witnessed and after overnight observation, the parents were anxious to go home.  The patient was started on Zithromax in the hospital.,CONDITION AND TREATMENT: , The patient was in stable condition and good condition on exam at the time and was discharged home on Zithromax to be followed up in the office within a week.,INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENT:,  Include usual diet and to follow up within a week, but certainly sooner if the coughing is worse and there is cyanosis or apnea again.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Possible sepsis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 10-month-old male who was seen in the office 1 day prior to admission.  He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks&#x27; gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: , He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Bilateral otitis media.,2.  Fever.,PLAN:  ,Recommended discharge.  No restrictions in diet or activity.  He was continued Omnicef 125 mg/5 mL one teaspoon p.o. once daily and instructed to follow up with Dr. X, his primary doctor, on the following Tuesday.  Parents were instructed also to call if new symptoms occurred or he had return if difficulties with breathing or increased lethargy.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient&#x27;s left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.

Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.

The patient underwent a 2-day induction.  On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress.  During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration.  Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication.  There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery.  It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay.  The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day.  The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.  It should be noted, however, that this was actually an expected result with the initial hematocrit of 32% preoperatively.  Therefore, there was anemia but not an unexplained anemia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: , Includes the stable vital signs, afebrile state.  An alert and oriented patient who is desirous at discharge.  Full range of motion, all extremities; fully ambulatory.  Pulse is regular and strong.  Lungs are clear and the abdomen is soft and nontender with minimal tympany and a nontender fundus.  The incision is beautiful and soft and nontender.  There is scant lochia and there is minimal edema.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Include hematocrit of 27% and the last liver function tests was within normal limits 48 hours prior to discharge.,FOLLOWUP: , For the patient includes pelvic rest, regular diet.  Follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks.  Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. cramps, Tylenol No.  3 one p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, prenatal vitamin one p.o. daily, and topical triple antibiotic to incision b.i.d. to q.i.d.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

At that time, she was diagnosed with CIN 3 as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.  She underwent a cone biopsy that per her report was negative for any pathology.  She had no vulvar treatment at that time.  Since that time, she has had normal Pap smears.  She denies abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pain.  She uses Yaz for birth control.  She reports one sexual partner since 1994 and she is a nonsmoker.,She states that she has a tendency to have yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis.  She is also being evaluated for a possible interstitial cystitis because she gets frequent urinary tract infections.  She had a normal mammogram done in August 2006 and a history of perirectal condyloma that have been treated by Dr. B.  She also has a history of chlamydia when she was in college.,PAST MEDICAL HX: , Depression.,PAST SURGICAL HX: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Lexapro 10 mg a day and Yaz.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,OB HX: , Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at term in 2001 and 2004, Abc weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces and Xyz weighed 10 pounds 5 ounces.,FAMILY HX:  ,Maternal grandfather who had a MI which she reports is secondary to tobacco and alcohol use.

PELVIC: Normal external female genitalia.  Vulva, vagina, and urethra, within normal limits.  Cervix is status post cone biopsy; however, the transformation zone grossly appears normal and cervical discharge is clear and normal in appearance.  GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.,Colposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.,A/P: , ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.,We will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.  We will check the results of the ECC.  She will return in two weeks for test results.  If these are normal, she will need two normal Pap smears six months apart, and I think followup colposcopy for the vulvar changes.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Researching the available records, I find only an EMS verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  There is no strip for me to review all available EKG tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm.,The patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at ABC Medical Center.  The aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  She states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  She has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion.,The patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  Last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted EMS.  Her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being Toprol-XL 100 mg q.a.m., Dyazide 25/37.5 mg, Nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  She has been maintaining her Crestor and Zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  She states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  She remains on Zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  Her only allergy is listed to latex.,OBJECTIVE:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  The patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional PAC.,GENERAL:  She is alert and in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Eyes:  EOMI.  PERRLA.  Sclerae nonicteric.  No lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  Funduscopic examination unremarkable.  Ears:  Normal set, shape, TMs, canals and hearing.  Nose and Sinuses:  Negative.  Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, and Throat:  Negative except for dental work.,NECK:  Supple and pain free without bruit, JVD, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.,CHEST:  Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  The incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.,HEART:  Shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  There is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no evidence of DVT, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  Gait and station were not tested.,MENTAL STATUS:  Shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.,BACK:  Negative to inspection or percussion.,LABORATORY DATA: , Shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  INR 1.0.  Electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  GFR is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  Glucose was 119.  Magnesium was 2.3.  Phosphorus 3.8.  Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient&#x27;s managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  Dr. Varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient Holter monitor and further followup post-discharge.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.,2.

She suffers from morbid obesity.  She also has diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea.  She was evaluated in the Bariatric Surgical Center for placement of a band.  During her workup, she was noted to have evidence of cholelithiasis.  It was felt that the patient would benefit from removal of her gallbladder prior to having band placement secondary to her diabetes and the risk of infection of the band.  The patient was scheduled to undergo her procedure on 12/31/09; however, at blood glucose check, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic, her sugar was 438.  She was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her hyperglycemia.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Ms. ABC was admitted to the hospital.  She was seen by Dr. A.  He put her on an insulin drip.  Her sugars slowly did come down to normal down to between 115 and 134.  On the next day, she was then taken to the operating room, where she underwent her laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was noted to be a difficult intubation for the procedure.  There were some indications of chronic cholecystitis, a little bit of edema, mild edema and adhesions of omentum around the gallbladder.  She underwent the procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She was recovered in the Postoperative Care Unit and then returned to the floor.  Her blood sugar postprocedure was noted to be 233.  She was started back on a sliding scale insulin.  She continued to do well and was felt to be stable for discharge following the procedure.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  ,To return to the Medifast diet.  To continue with her blood glucose.  She needs to follow up with Dr. B, and she will see me next week on Friday.  We will determine if we will proceed with her lap band at that time.  She may shower.  She needs to keep her wounds clean and dry.  No heavy lifting.  No driving on narcotic pain medicines.  She needs to continue with her CPAP machine and continue to monitor her sugars.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;REASON FOR CONSULT:,  Organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma.,SOURCE OF HISTORY:  ,The patient himself is not able to give a good history.  History has obtained through discussion with Dr. X over the phone and the nurse taking care of the patient despite reviewing the chart on the floor.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old male with the history of multiple myeloma, who has been admitted for complains of being dehydrated and was doing good until this morning, was found to be disoriented and confused, was not able to communicate properly, and having difficulty leaving out the words.  Not a very clear history at this time and the patient himself is not able to give any history despite no family member was present in the room.  Neurology consult was called to evaluate any organic brain syndrome in the setting of multiple myeloma.  The patient since the morning has improved, but still not completely back to the baseline.  Even I evaluated the patient previously, hence not very sure about his baseline.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of IgG subtype multiple myeloma.,SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Nothing significant.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  ,Nothing significant.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,No history of any smoking, alcohol or drug abuse.,ALLERGIES: , CODEINE AND FLAGYL.,IMMUNIZATION HISTORY: , Nothing significant.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Unobtainable.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,The patient was considered to ask question for systemic review including neurology, psychiatry, sleep, ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary, cardiology, gastroenterology, genitourinary, hematology, rheumatology, dermatology, allergy/immunology, endocrinology, toxicology, oncology, and found to be positive for the symptoms mentioned in the history of the presenting illness.  The patient himself is not able to give any history only source is the chart.  For details, please review the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure of 97/54, heart rate of 97, respiratory rate of 19, and temperature 98.5.  The patient on supplemental oxygen was FiO2 on 2 L 96%.  Limited physical examination.,HEENT:  Head, normocephalic and atraumatic.  Throat clear.  No discharge from the ear and the nose.  No discoloration of conjunctivae and the sclerae.,NECK:  Supple.  No signs of any meningismus.  Though a limited examination, the patient does appear to have arthritic changes, questioning contracture deformities, as not able to follow the commands to show full range of motion.  No bruit auscultated over the neck and the orbits.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.,HEART:  Normal heart sounds.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  No edema, clubbing or cyanosis.  No rash.  No leptomeningeal or neurocutaneous disorder.,NEUROLOGIC:  Examination is limited.  Mental state examination, the patient is awake, alert, and oriented to himself, not able follow commands, and give a proper history, and still appeared to be confuse and disoriented.  Cranial nerve examination limited, but apparently nonfocal.  Motor examination is very limited except for the grips, which were strong enough.  I was not able to obtain much.  Deep tendon reflexes were not reliable.  Toes equivocal and downgoing.  Sensory examination is not reliable, though intact for painful stimuli with limited examination.  Coordination could not be tested.  Gait could not be tested.,IMPRESSION:,  History of multiple myeloma and altered mental status in multiple myeloma setting.  Rule out brain metastasis including lepto-meningismus, possible transient ischemic attack related to hyperviscosity syndrome or provoked seizure related to ischemia, and delirium related to any electrolyte imbalance or underlying infarction.,PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient is to continue with current level of management.  I will review the chart before ordering any further testing that may include a CT scan of the brain, if has not been ordered, EEG, urine test, and the latest CBC with diff. to rule out any urinary tract infection or indication of any other seen of infection.  No other intervention at this time.  The patient may be started on aspirin, if it is okay with Dr. X.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Pap smear in November 2006 showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.  She has a history of an abnormal Pap smear.  At that time, she was diagnosed with CIN 3 as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.  She underwent a cone biopsy that per her report was negative for any pathology.  She had no vulvar treatment at that time.  Since that time, she has had normal Pap smears.  She denies abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pain.  She uses Yaz for birth control.  She reports one sexual partner since 1994 and she is a nonsmoker.,She states that she has a tendency to have yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis.  She is also being evaluated for a possible interstitial cystitis because she gets frequent urinary tract infections.  She had a normal mammogram done in August 2006 and a history of perirectal condyloma that have been treated by Dr. B.  She also has a history of chlamydia when she was in college.,PAST MEDICAL HX: , Depression.,PAST SURGICAL HX: , None.,MEDICATIONS: , Lexapro 10 mg a day and Yaz.,ALLERGIES: , NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,OB HX: , Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at term in 2001 and 2004, Abc weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces and Xyz weighed 10 pounds 5 ounces.,FAMILY HX:  ,Maternal grandfather who had a MI which she reports is secondary to tobacco and alcohol use.  He currently has metastatic melanoma, mother with hypertension and depression, father with alcoholism.,SOCIAL HX:,  She is a public relations consultant.  She is a nonsmoker, drinks infrequent alcohol and does not use drugs.  She enjoys horseback riding and teaches jumping.,PE: , VITALS: Height: 5 feet 6 inches.  Weight: 139 lb.  BMI: 22.4.  Blood Pressure: 102/58.  GENERAL: She is well-developed and well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  She is alert and oriented to time, place, and person and her mood and affect is normal.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  BREASTS: Deferred.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Normal external female genitalia.  Vulva, vagina, and urethra, within normal limits.  Cervix is status post cone biopsy; however, the transformation zone grossly appears normal and cervical discharge is clear and normal in appearance.  GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.,Colposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.,A/P: , ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.,We will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.  We will check the results of the ECC.  She will return in two weeks for test results.  If these are normal, she will need two normal Pap smears six months apart, and I think followup colposcopy for the vulvar changes.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Greater saphenous vein stripping and stab phlebectomies requiring 10 to 20 incisions, right leg.,2.  Greater saphenous vein stripping and stab phlebectomies requiring 10 to 20 incisions, left leg.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a general endotracheal anesthesia.  A time-out process was followed and antibiotics were given.,Then, both legs were prepped and draped in the usual fashion with the patient was in the supine position.  An incision was made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at its junction with the femoral vein was dissected out and all branches were ligated and divided.  Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen.  A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities.  Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly.  Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis.  Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side.  Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there.  The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient&#x27;s position would allow us.  Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg.  The stab phlebectomies were performed with a hook and they were very satisfactory.  Hemostasis achieved with compression and then staples were applied to the skin.,Then, the patient was rolled onto a stretcher where both legs were wrapped with the Kerlix, fluffs, and Ace bandages.,Estimated blood loss probably was about 150 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  The patient is to be observed, so a decision will be made whether she needs to stay overnight or be able to go home.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Cystoscopy, bilaterally retrograde pyelograms, insertion of bilateral externalized ureteral stents.,2.  Exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy, IPHC with mitomycin-C.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a pleasant 56-year-old gentleman with no significant past medical history who after an extensive workup for peritoneal carcinomatosis from appendiceal primary was admitted on MM/DD/YYYY.  He was admitted to General Surgery C Service for a routine preoperative evaluation including baseline labs, bowel prep, urology consult for ureteral stent placement.  The patient was taken to the operative suite on MM/DD/YYYY and was first seen by Urology for a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement.  Dr. XYZ performed an exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy, and IPHC with mitomycin-C.  The procedure was without complications.  The patient was observed closely in the ICU for one day postoperatively for persistent tachycardia after extubation.  He was then transferred to the floor where he has done exceptionally well.,On postoperative day #2, the patient passed flatus and we were able to start a clear liquid diet.  We advanced him as tolerated to a regular health select diet by postoperative day #4.  His pain was well controlled throughout this hospitalization, initially with a PCA pump, which he very seldomly used.  He was then switched over to p.o. pain medicines and has required very little for adequate pain control.  By postoperative date #2, the patient had been out of bed and ambulating in the hallways.  The patient&#x27;s only problem was with some mild diarrhea on postoperative days #3 and 4.  This was thought to be a result of his right hemicolectomy.  A C. diff toxin was sent and came back negative and he was started on Imodium to manage his diarrhea.  His post-splenectomy vaccines including pneumococcal, HiB, and meningococcal vaccines were administered during his hospitalization.,On the day of discharge, the patient was resting comfortably in the bed without complaints.  He had been afebrile throughout his hospitalization and his vital signs were stable.  Pertinent physical exam findings include that his abdomen was soft, nondistended and nontender with bowel sounds present throughout.  His midline incision is clean, dry, and intact and staples are in place.  He is just six days postop, he will go home with his staples in place and they will be removed on his follow-up appointment.,CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  ,The patient was discharged in good and stable condition.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  Multivitamins daily.,2.  Lovenox 40 mg in 0.4 mL solution inject subcutaneously once daily for 14 days.,3.  Vicodin 5/500 mg and take one tablet by mouth every four hours as needed for pain.,4.  Phenergan 12.5 mg tablets, take one tablet by mouth every six hours p.r.n. for nausea.,5.  Imodium A-D tablets take one tablet by mouth b.i.d. as needed for diarrhea.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:,  The patient was instructed to contact us with any questions or concerns that may arise.  In addition, he was instructed to contact us, if he would have fevers greater than 101.4, chills, nausea or vomitting, continuing diarrhea, redness, drainage, or warmth around his incision site.  He will be seen in about one week&#x27;s time in Dr. XYZ&#x27;s clinic and his staples will be removed at that time.,FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: , The patient will be seen by Dr. XYZ in clinic in one week&#x27;s time.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

These changes are expected to have long-lasting impacts on centennial to millennial time scales.&quot;,&quot;Some options for scaling up mitigation and adaptation in developing regions according to the context include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilized private finance flows from developed to developing countries.\\\\n2. Use of public guarantees to reduce risks and leverage private flows at lower cost.\\\\n3. Development of local capital markets.\\\\n4. Building greater trust in international cooperation processes.&quot;,&quot;An abrupt collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is expected to cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and the water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt. This event would have significant impacts on ecosystems and human activities.&quot;,&quot;The projected impacts on water management measures by a 3\\\\u00b0C global warming include higher direct flood damages by 2.5 to 3.9 times compared to 1.5\\\\u00b0C global warming without adaptation. Furthermore, at 4\\\\u00b0C of warming, approximately 4 billion people are projected to experience water scarcity.&quot;,&quot;The projected population assumptions for the years 2050 range from 8.5 to 9.7 billion, and for the year 2100 range from 7.4 to 10.9 billion based on the modelled global emissions pathways.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, achieving net negative CO2 emissions requires the implementation of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies.&quot;,&quot;The impacts of climate change on urban infrastructure, as highlighted in the IPCC report, include compromised transportation, water, sanitation, and energy systems. This has led to economic losses, disruptions of services, and impacts on well-being. Extreme and slow-onset events have affected urban infrastructure, resulting in limitations in functioning and compromised services. These impacts are especially significant for economically and socially marginalized urban residents, such as those living in informal settlements.&quot;,&quot;The projected global warming levels for different GHG emissions scenarios in the near term (2021\\\\u20132040) are as follows:\\\\n- SSP1-1.9: 1.5 [1.2 to 1.7]\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP1-2.6: 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP2-4.5: 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP3-7.0: 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP5-8.5: 1.6 [1.3 to 1.9]\\\\u00b0C\\\\n\\\\nGHG emissions scenarios include very low, low, intermediate, high, and very high scenarios based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). These scenarios project varying levels of CO2 emissions over time, with some reaching net zero emissions by around 2050 or 2070 and even transitioning to net negative CO2 emissions. Different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were utilized to evaluate regional climate changes and risks associated with these emissions scenarios.&quot;,&quot;Limiting global warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C compared to 2\\\\u00b0C, as outlined in the IPCC report, would require deeper and more rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving the 1.5\\\\u00b0C target would necessitate a more accelerated pace of emission reductions, with global emissions projected to fall by a larger percentage below 2019 levels by specific target years. This underscores the urgency of taking immediate and substantial actions to mitigate climate change and reduce the risks associated with higher levels of global warming.&quot;,&quot;The projected impacts of global warming on food availability include reduced food security, negative crop yield impacts in mid- and low latitude regions, slowed growth in agricultural productivity globally, adverse effects on food production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in some oceanic regions, and increased risks of nutrition-related diseases and undernourishment affecting millions of people, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in specific regions.\\\\n\\\\nThe projected impacts of global warming on nutrition-related diseases include estimates that changes in food availability and diet quality will increase the prevalence of nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people. This is particularly expected to affect tens to hundreds of millions of individuals, especially among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.&quot;,&quot;The benefits of accelerated implementation of adaptation according to the IPCC report include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Improving well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations.\\\\n2. Reducing future adaptation costs and losses and damages through deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions.\\\\n3. Enhancing sustainable development co-benefits.\\\\n4. Avoiding locking-in emission sources and reducing stranded assets and irreversible climate changes.\\\\n5. Bringing benefits to human well-being through accelerated implementation of adaptation responses.\\\\n6. Long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, are important to close adaptation gaps.\\\\n7. Recognizing that constraints remain for some regions, but the benefits to vulnerable populations would be high.&quot;,&quot;Achieving global net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires all remaining CO2 and metric-weighted non-CO2 GHG emissions to be counterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals. Some non-CO2 emissions, such as CH4 and N2O from agriculture, cannot be fully eliminated using existing and anticipated technical measures. Global net zero CO2 or GHG emissions can be achieved even if some sectors and regions are net emitters, provided that others reach net negative emissions. The potential and cost of achieving net zero or even net negative emissions vary by sector and region, depending on factors such as the potential to reduce GHG emissions, undertake carbon dioxide removal, associated costs, and the availability of policy mechanisms to balance emissions and removals between sectors and countries.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, human activities, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming. This has resulted in a rise in global surface temperatures by 1.1\\\\u00b0C above the levels of 1850-1900 during the period of 2011-2020. The impact of human-caused climate change is evident in various weather and climate extremes globally, leading to adverse effects on food and water security, human health, economies, societies, and nature. The report also highlights that vulnerable communities, despite contributing the least to current climate change, are disproportionately affected by these impacts.&quot;,&quot;Factors affecting the adoption and implementation of net zero emission targets by countries include equity and capacity considerations, clarity on scope, plans-of-action, fairness, policies, institutions, and milestones for tracking progress.&quot;,&quot;Human activities, particularly the emissions of well-mixed greenhouse gases, are assessed to have contributed significantly to the warming of global mean surface air temperature since 1850-1900. The estimated range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase during this period is between 0.8\\\\u00b0C to 1.3\\\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 1.07\\\\u00b0C. Well-mixed greenhouse gases are likely to have contributed a warming effect of 1.0\\\\u00b0C to 2.0\\\\u00b0C, while other human drivers, mainly aerosols, contributed a cooling effect of 0.0\\\\u00b0C to 0.8\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) can fulfill three complementary roles according to the assessed modelled pathways:\\\\n\\\\n1. Lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term.\\\\n2. Counterbalancing &amp;#x27;hard-to-abate&amp;#x27; residual emissions to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions.\\\\n3. Achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions.&quot;,&quot;The striped hexagons in the IPCC AR6 WGI inhabited regions assessment represent low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole.&quot;,&quot;The precise percentage for the period 2070-2075 in the data for net zero greenhouse gas pathways is 100%.&quot;,&quot;The anticipated risks and impacts of global warming levels on natural systems without adaptation measures include risks of species losses due to dangerous temperature conditions, risks to human health from hypothermic conditions, impacts on food production such as changes in maize yield, decline of coral reefs, loss of mass or disappearance of glaciers, and regions at higher risk like Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states, and Least Developed Countries.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, the projected risks and impacts of global warming levels on human systems without adaptation measures include increased risks to human health due to exposure to hypothermic conditions, potential declines in food production such as changes in maize yield, and higher levels of risk to human security, livelihoods, and economic growth.&quot;,&quot;Enhancing adaptive capacity can influence migration choices in the context of climate change by minimizing the risks associated with involuntary migration and immobility. This improvement in adaptive capacity can provide individuals with a greater degree of choice when making migration decisions. Additionally, policy interventions that focus on removing barriers and expanding alternatives for safe, orderly, and regular migration can further enhance the ability of vulnerable populations to adapt to climate change.\\\\n\\\\nPolicy interventions and the removal of barriers can influence safe migration in the context of climate change by expanding the alternatives for safe, orderly, and regular migration. This allows vulnerable people to adapt to climate change by improving the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made.&quot;,&quot;The biophysical factors considered in the projected regional impacts on maize yield, excluding potential effects from pests, diseases, or future agro-technological changes, include changing temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, wind, and CO2 enhancement of growth and water retention in currently cultivated areas. These factors are assumed to affect maize yield in irrigated areas where water limitation is not a constraint.&quot;,&quot;Here are the four distinct types of assessed modelled global pathways for greenhouse gas emissions over the period 2015-2050 along with the associated conditions:\\\\n\\\\n1. Trend from implemented policies:\\\\n   - Condition: Near-term GHG emissions aligned with policies implemented until the end of 2020 and extended with comparable ambition levels beyond 2030.\\\\n\\\\n2. Limit to 2\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;67%) or return warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;50%) after a high overshoot, NDCs until 2030:\\\\n   - Condition: GHG emissions until 2030 linked to the implementation of NDCs announced before COP26, followed by accelerated emissions reductions to limit warming to 2\\\\u00b0C or return warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with a probability of 50% or greater after high overshoot.\\\\n\\\\n3. Limit to 2\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;67%) with immediate action:\\\\n   - Condition: Pathways that restrict warming to 2\\\\u00b0C with immediate action after 2020.\\\\n\\\\n4. Limit to 1.5\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot:\\\\n   - Condition: Pathways that cap warming at 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot.&quot;,&quot;The risks associated with climate change are projected to increase with every increment of global warming. As global warming levels rise, the assessed long-term impacts are expected to be higher, with risks becoming increasingly severe. Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher at 1.5\\\\u00b0C of global warming compared to present levels, but lower than at 2\\\\u00b0C. Adverse impacts and related losses from climate change are expected to escalate with each increment of global warming, making the management of these risks more complex and challenging.\\\\n\\\\nAt specific warming levels like 1.5\\\\u00b0C compared to 2\\\\u00b0C, there are implications such as very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots increasing at least tenfold, and projected increases in direct flood damages being higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2\\\\u00b0C compared to 1.5\\\\u00b0C global warming without adaptation.&quot;,&quot;The specific projected global greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2030 in pathways aiming to restrict global warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot are estimated to be 43% compared to 2019 levels.&quot;,&quot;Some of the most effective adaptation strategies for vector-borne diseases include surveillance, early warning systems, and vaccine development. These strategies involve monitoring the spread and prevalence of diseases through surveillance and developing vaccines to prevent and control the transmission of these diseases effectively. By incorporating surveillance and vaccine development, adaptation strategies can help in mitigating the impact of vector-borne diseases in the face of climate change.&quot;,&quot;The severe water scarcity affecting approximately half of the global population, especially in vulnerable regions like Africa, Asia, and the Arctic, is influenced by several factors. These include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Unsustainable agricultural expansion driven by unbalanced diets, leading to increased vulnerability for ecosystems and humans and competition for land and water resources.\\\\n2. Increasing weather and climate extreme events exposing millions of people to acute food insecurity and reduced water security.\\\\n\\\\nThese factors contribute significantly to the water scarcity challenges faced by populations in these regions.&quot;,&quot;The global modelled pathways aiming to limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with minimal or no overshoot achieve net zero CO2 emissions before achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. This is achieved through counterbalancing net negative CO2 emissions. The approximate year by which net zero CO2 emissions are reached in these pathways is in the early 2050s.&quot;,&quot;In the IPCC report, specific methods proposed for reducing carbon emissions in light industry and manufacturing include material efficiency, circularity, electrification using methods like electrothermal heating and heat pumps, and switching to low- and zero-GHG emitting fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, and bio-based and synthetic fuels. Additionally, deep reduction of cement process emissions can be achieved through cementitious material substitution and the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) until new chemistries are developed.\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to addressing emissions from cement production, the strategies focus on cementitious material substitution and the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) until new chemistries are developed.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, for reducing carbon emissions in chemicals production, the proposed methods include material efficiency, circularity, increased plastics recycling, fuel and feedstock switching, carbon sourced through biogenic sources, Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), direct air CO2 capture, as well as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).&quot;,&quot;In developing nations, especially the least developed countries, the barriers and challenges hindering the widespread adoption of low-emission technologies include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Barriers in Developing Nations:\\\\n   - Limited finance, technology development, and transfer.\\\\n   - Weak capacity building.\\\\n   - Adverse side-effects from the diffusion of low-emission technology, such as low-value employment and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers.\\\\n   - Insufficient institutional and financial support.\\\\n   - Uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs.\\\\n   - Weak governance.\\\\n   - Insecure land ownership.\\\\n   - Low incomes and lack of access to alternative income sources.\\\\n   - Risk of reversal in progress.\\\\n\\\\n2. Challenges in Least Developed Countries:\\\\n   - Limited finance, technology development, and transfer.\\\\n   - Weak capacity building.\\\\n\\\\nAddressing these barriers and challenges is crucial for promoting the adoption of low-emission technologies in developing nations, especially in the least developed countries.&quot;,&quot;- Ocean warming accounts for 91% of the heating in the climate system.\\\\n- Land warming contributes around 0.5% to the overall heating.\\\\n- Ice loss is estimated to contribute between 3% to 14% to the overall heating.\\\\n- Atmospheric warming is estimated to contribute between 100% to 200% to the overall heating.&quot;,&quot;In the context of creating synthetic diagrams for regions such as Small Islands, Asia, and Central and South America, the specific challenges or limitations encountered include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Small Islands: Challenges include the scarcity of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies, and the varying socioeconomic contexts across countries within the region.\\\\n\\\\n2. Asia: Challenges involve the scarcity of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies, and the varying socioeconomic contexts across countries within the region.\\\\n\\\\n3. Central and South America: Challenges include the scarcity of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies, the diversity of socioeconomic contexts across countries within the region, and the resulting limited number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.&quot;,&quot;Boosting both mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing nations is deemed essential through accelerated support from developed countries and multilateral institutions. This support can address inequities in finance, including costs, terms, and conditions, and enhance economic vulnerability to climate change. Scaled-up public grants for mitigation and adaptation funding in vulnerable regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, are highlighted as cost-effective with high social returns, particularly in terms of access to basic energy. Additionally, increasing levels of public finance, mobilizing private finance flows, utilizing public guarantees to reduce risks, developing local capital markets, and building trust in international cooperation processes are all crucial strategies outlined in the report to enhance climate action in developing regions.&quot;,&quot;The SSP1 pathway is characterized by low population growth, high income, reduced inequalities, food production in low greenhouse gas emission systems, effective land use regulation, and high adaptive capacity to climate-related challenges. On the other hand, the SSP3 pathway shows higher population growth, lower income, increased inequalities, reliance on high greenhouse gas emission systems for food production, less effective land use regulation, and lower adaptive capacity.\\\\n\\\\nPopulation growth trends in SSP1 are influenced by factors such as low population growth, high income, reduced inequalities, food production in low greenhouse gas emission systems, effective land use regulation, and high adaptive capacity. In contrast, population growth trends in SSP3 are influenced by opposite trends compared to SSP1, including higher population growth, lower income, increased inequalities, reliance on high greenhouse gas emission systems for food production, less effective land use regulation, and lower adaptive capacity.\\\\n\\\\nFactors influencing the capacity to adapt to climate-related challenges in SSP1 and SSP3 include societal choices and actions, enabling conditions, barriers to feasibility, and the need for integrated, multi-sectoral solutions. These factors play a crucial role in determining the extent to which medium and long-term development pathways can deliver climate-resilient outcomes in the face of climate change.\\\\n\\\\nSocio-economic factors influencing SSP1 and SSP3 pathways include population growth, income levels, inequalities, food production methods, land use regulations, and adaptive capacity. SSP1 represents a world with low population growth, high income, reduced inequalities, food produced in low greenhouse gas emission systems, effective land use regulation, and high adaptive capacity. In contrast, SSP3 depicts opposite trends in these socio-economic factors.&quot;,&quot;The expected net increase in global temperature by the year 2100 compared to 2019 in the SSP3-7.0 scenario, considering changes in short-lived climate forcers like methane and aerosols, is likely to be between 0.4\\\\u00b0C to 0.9\\\\u00b0C.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the expected net increase in global temperature by the year 2100 compared to 2019, considering changes in short-lived climate forcers like methane and aerosols, is also likely to be between 0.4\\\\u00b0C to 0.9\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;Some specific consequences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems include substantial damages and increasingly irreversible losses in terrestrial, freshwater, cryospheric, coastal, and open ocean ecosystems. Climate change impacts are larger than previously estimated, leading to species shifting polewards or to higher elevations. Biological responses are often insufficient to cope with recent climate change, resulting in local losses of species and mass mortality events. Some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility due to hydrological changes from glacier retreat and permafrost thaw. Slow-onset processes like ocean acidification, sea level rise, and regional decreases in precipitation are also attributed to human-caused climate change, contributing to desertification and land degradation in various areas. Additionally, nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last century due to a combination of human pressures, sea level rise, warming, and extreme climate events.\\\\n\\\\nSpecific consequences of ocean acidification on ecosystems include more frequent and extensive coral bleaching, subsequent coral mortality, and degradation of coral reef ecosystems.\\\\n\\\\nLosses of coastal ecosystems and ecosystem services, groundwater salinization, flooding, and damages to coastal infrastructure are specific consequences of sea level rise on ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;In sector/system potentials figures in WGII and WGIII:\\\\n- Synergies are visually represented by the blue proportion within the bars.\\\\n- Trade-offs are visually represented by the orange proportion within the bars.\\\\n- Positive links are represented by the blue proportion within the bars, while negative links are represented by the orange proportion within the bars.\\\\n- Normalization to 100% is visually represented by ensuring that the length of each bar in the figure corresponds to the total number of mitigation or adaptation options under each system/sector.&quot;,&quot;Instances of maladaptation and the conditions under which they occur in various sectors or regions include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Agriculture Sector:\\\\n   - Maladaptation occurs when farmers lack access to climate-resilient technologies and practices, leading to decreased crop yields and food insecurity.\\\\n   - Conditions: Limited financial resources, inadequate extension services, and lack of knowledge about climate-smart agriculture practices.\\\\n\\\\n2. Water Management Sector:\\\\n   - Maladaptation can be seen when water infrastructure is not designed to withstand extreme weather events, resulting in flooding and water scarcity.\\\\n   - Conditions: Aging infrastructure, inadequate maintenance, and lack of integrated water resource management.\\\\n\\\\n3. Urban Planning Sector:\\\\n   - Maladaptation occurs in urban areas when development projects ignore climate risks, leading to increased vulnerability to heatwaves, flooding, and sea-level rise.\\\\n   - Conditions: Rapid urbanization, informal settlements, and weak governance structures.\\\\n\\\\n4. Health Sector:\\\\n   - Maladaptation is evident when healthcare systems are unprepared for climate-related health impacts, such as the spread of vector-borne diseases and heat-related illnesses.\\\\n   - Conditions: Limited healthcare infrastructure, lack of public health awareness, and inadequate response mechanisms.\\\\n\\\\n5. Coastal Communities:\\\\n   - Maladaptation occurs in coastal regions when communities rely on ineffective coastal protection measures, resulting in increased exposure to storm surges and erosion.\\\\n   - Conditions: Limited access to early warning systems, unsustainable coastal development, and lack of community engagement in adaptation planning.\\\\n\\\\nThese instances highlight the importance of addressing systemic barriers, promoting equity, and prioritizing transformational adaptation to build resilience in various sectors and regions.&quot;,&quot;Some potential risks associated with Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) approaches that might affect the feasibility of integrated and multi-sectoral adaptation strategies in the context of climate risks include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Introducing a widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems that are not well understood.\\\\n2. Inability to restore climate to a previous state leading to substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at regional and seasonal scales.\\\\n3. Rapid climate change if SRM is suddenly and sustainably terminated in a high CO2 emissions scenario.\\\\n4. Inability to stop atmospheric CO2 concentrations from increasing or reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions.\\\\n5. Presence of large uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the effectiveness of SRM approaches in reducing climate change risks.\\\\n6. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create international tensions.\\\\n\\\\nThese risks could potentially hinder the feasibility of integrated and multi-sectoral adaptation strategies by making the risks more severe and difficult to manage. The concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to various sectors such as food systems, human settlements, infrastructure, and health, along with interactions with non-climatic risk drivers, could complicate the implementation of comprehensive adaptation strategies across different sectors. Additionally, the projected increase in transboundary risks across food, energy, and water sectors due to weather and climate extremes could further challenge the effectiveness of integrated adaptation approaches.&quot;,&quot;The thin lines in the assessed remaining carbon budgets and fossil fuel infrastructure emissions indicate uncertainty due to the contribution of non-CO2 warming and the assessed sensitivity range, respectively. \\\\n\\\\nThe significance of uncertainty due to non-CO2 warming and the sensitivity range of emissions in integrated system approaches for climate resilient development lies in their impact on adaptation strategies and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. These uncertainties can influence the development pathways chosen by countries, affecting their ability to address climate risks and vulnerabilities. By considering the sensitivity range of emissions and the uncertainties related to non-CO2 warming, integrated system approaches can better assess the potential risks and opportunities for climate resilient development, guiding decision-making towards more effective and sustainable solutions.&quot;,&quot;Factors contributing to higher vulnerability to climate change in regions that are expected to experience significant near-term climate impacts include changes in the degree of the hazard, the population exposed, and the degree of vulnerability of people, assets, or ecosystems. These regions may see an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming, such as concurrent heatwaves and drought, which can lead to severe consequences for health, food production, and overall societal well-being. Additionally, risks are exacerbated by interactions between sudden food production losses from heat and drought, heat-induced labor productivity losses, and other non-climatic risk drivers like competition for land and pandemics. Loss of ecosystems and their services also plays a significant role in increasing vulnerability, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who rely directly on ecosystems for their basic needs.&quot;,&quot;In climate-crop models, hatching indicates areas where less than 70% of the model combinations agree on the sign of impact. In climate-fisheries models, hatching indicates areas where the two models disagree in the direction of change.\\\\n\\\\nRegions with significant technological advancements in low-emission systems, as described in the IPCC report, can positively impact climate models. These advancements contribute to lower emissions growth, create social and environmental co-benefits, and support the diffusion of low-carbon technological innovations. Tailoring these advancements to national contexts and technological characteristics can promote the adoption of low-emission technologies. International cooperation on innovation systems and technology development can accelerate the global diffusion of mitigation technologies, practices, and policies, aligning them with other development objectives.&quot;,&quot;The Reasons for Concern (RFCs) identified in relation to climate change risks as global surface temperatures continue to rise in the IPCC&amp;#x27;s Sixth Assessment Report are as follows:\\\\n1. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems\\\\n2. RFC2: Extreme weather events\\\\n3. RFC3: Distribution of impacts\\\\n4. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts\\\\n5. RFC5: Large-scale singular events\\\\n\\\\nThese RFCs highlight the scientific understanding of the accumulation of risk across different categories as outlined in the report.&quot;,&quot;The specific factors that hinder the adoption of low-emission technologies in developing countries include limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. In regions facing significant adaptation challenges, the barriers include limited finance, technology development and transfer, capacity constraints, weak enabling conditions, adverse side-effects of technology diffusion such as low-value employment and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers, insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes, lack of access to alternative income sources, and the risk of reversal.&quot;,&quot;Some adaptation options in the agriculture sector that can effectively mitigate climate risks while contributing to sustainable land management include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Cultivar improvements\\\\n2. On-farm water management and storage\\\\n3. Soil moisture conservation\\\\n4. Irrigation\\\\n5. Agroforestry\\\\n6. Community-based adaptation\\\\n7. Farm and landscape level diversification\\\\n8. Sustainable land management approaches\\\\n\\\\nThese options provide multiple benefits, reduce climate risks, and contribute positively to sustainable development and other societal goals.&quot;,&quot;The horizontal lines in Figure 3.3 of the IPCC report separate the observed past impacts below the line from the future projected risks above it. This division at the present global warming level of 1.1\\\\u00b0C is significant for understanding the transition from moderate to high risk across different assessments. It emphasizes irreversibility and adaptation limits, essential for sustainable development and addressing climate risks. These lines visually represent the evolving challenges and the need for proactive measures to mitigate future climate-related threats.&quot;,&quot;The likelihood of global warming reaching 1.5\\\\u00b0C between 2021 and 2040 under very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios is high. In most considered scenarios and modelled pathways, global warming is expected to reach 1.5\\\\u00b0C in the first half of the 2030s.&quot;,&quot;The remaining carbon budget (RCB) for limiting global warming to 2\\\\u00b0C with a 67% likelihood starting from 2020 is 1150 GtCO2.&quot;,&quot;Non-climatic risk drivers that interact with climate change risks in scenarios very likely to occur, according to the IPCC, include competition for land between urban expansion and food production, as well as pandemics. These factors can exacerbate the challenges posed by climate change and contribute to complex risk landscapes.&quot;,&quot;The AR6 framework assesses future greenhouse gas emissions by considering socio-economic development and policy, emissions pathways, global surface temperature responses to various scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5), global mean temperature change categorizations (C1\\\\u2013C8), and risks and impacts associated with different levels of warming. The framework includes the assessment of GHGs, aerosols, ozone precursors, and their impacts on global surface temperature changes throughout the 21st century.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding climate change, the AR6 framework assesses aspects such as future greenhouse gas emissions, climate change risks, impacts, and mitigation strategies. It considers socio-economic development, emissions pathways, global surface temperature responses under different scenarios, global mean temperature change categorizations, and risks associated with increasing warming. The framework also evaluates the interaction of hazard with vulnerability, exposure, and response to climate change, recognizing the interdependence of climate, ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies.&quot;,&quot;Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, such as cash transfers and public works, can enhance resilience to climate change by providing vulnerable populations with the necessary resources and support to cope with the impacts of climate change. Climate adaptation measures in social protection programs can include building climate-resilient infrastructure, diversifying livelihoods, strengthening social safety nets, enhancing early warning systems, and promoting community participation.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, by integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, vulnerable populations can enhance their adaptive capacity by developing the skills and knowledge needed to adapt to changing climate conditions, such as training in climate-resilient farming practices.&quot;,&quot;Implementing deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions offers several benefits:\\\\n\\\\n1. Deep Mitigation Actions:\\\\n   - Reducing future adaptation costs and losses\\\\n   - Enhancing sustainable development co-benefits\\\\n   - Avoiding locking-in emission sources\\\\n   - Reducing stranded assets\\\\n   - Mitigating irreversible climate changes\\\\n\\\\n2. Rapid Mitigation Actions:\\\\n   - Reducing future adaptation costs and losses\\\\n   - Enhancing sustainable development co-benefits\\\\n   - Avoiding locking-in emission sources\\\\n   - Reducing stranded assets\\\\n   - Preventing irreversible climate changes\\\\n\\\\n3. Sustained Mitigation Actions:\\\\n   - Reducing future adaptation costs and losses\\\\n   - Enhancing sustainable development co-benefits\\\\n   - Avoiding locking-in emission sources\\\\n   - Reducing stranded assets\\\\n   - Mitigating irreversible climate changes\\\\n\\\\nThese actions may involve higher upfront investments and disruptive changes but can be facilitated by enabling conditions and the removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility.&quot;,&quot;The best estimate is that global warming will reach 1.5\\\\u00b0C in most scenarios by the first half of the 2030s.&quot;,&quot;The confidence level regarding the risk of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in coral reefs due to warming levels is very high.&quot;,&quot;The level of confidence in the scientific evidence regarding climate change as a threat to human well-being and planetary health is very high. The uncertainty ranges provided by climate model emulators like MAGICC and FaIR cover both the uncertainty of the emissions pathways as well as the climate emulators&amp;#x27; uncertainty.&quot;,&quot;The projected global population in low-lying coastal zones by 2050 according to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are as follows:\\\\n- SSP1: More than one billion people\\\\n- SSP2: More than one billion people\\\\n- SSP3: Data not provided\\\\n- SSP4: Data not provided\\\\n- SSP5: More than one billion people&quot;,&quot;The increase in global surface temperature from 1850\\\\u20131900 to 2011\\\\u20132020 has been approximately 1.1\\\\u00b0C. If high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions persist, this trend is likely to continue with further warming of the Earth&amp;#x27;s surface.&quot;,&quot;Aligning goals and actions across sectors in climate resilient development provides opportunities for multiple and large-scale benefits and avoided damages in the near term. Such measures can achieve greater benefits through cascading effects across sectors. For example, combining options like using land for both agriculture and centralized solar production can increase feasibility. Integrated planning and operations in transport and energy infrastructure can reduce environmental, social, and economic impacts. Implementing packages of multiple city-scale mitigation strategies can have cascading effects across sectors and reduce greenhouse gas emissions both within and outside city boundaries. Integrated design approaches in construction and retrofitting of buildings offer examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings in various regions.\\\\n\\\\nEquitable investment in climate resilient development brings benefits such as advancing sustainable development, avoiding damages from climate change, and securing a liveable and sustainable future for all. It also helps in reconciling divergent interests, values, and worldviews, leading to equitable and just outcomes.&quot;,&quot;International cooperation contributes to climate resilient development by enabling increased access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors, and communities. It aligns finance flows for climate action with ambition levels and funding needs, facilitating the shift towards sustainability. Additionally, international cooperation and coordination, including combined policy packages, are crucial for sustainability transitions in emissions-intensive industries exposed to international competition. This collaboration helps secure financial flows, address inequality and poverty issues, and reduce policy costs across regions, ultimately supporting climate resilient development.\\\\n\\\\nThe latest strategies for international cooperation in climate change involve integrating equity and climate justice into national and international policies to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability. This includes mobilizing and enhancing access to finance for vulnerable regions, sectors, and communities. Additionally, international cooperation and coordination, along with combined policy packages, are deemed crucial for sustainability transitions in emissions-intensive industries exposed to international competition. Furthermore, significant international cooperation is assumed in emission modeling studies to secure financial flows, address inequality and poverty issues, and limit global warming. The effects of mitigation on GDP across regions vary based on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design, and the level of international cooperation. Delayed global cooperation is noted to increase policy costs across regions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement contributes to climate resilient development by fostering policy development, target-setting, and enhanced transparency at national and sub-national levels. It requires countries to articulate their priorities and ambition regarding climate action through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Additionally, the agreement recognizes the importance of adaptation and mitigation efforts, which are essential components of climate resilient development.&quot;,&quot;The five broad categories of risk according to the Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework in the IPCC report are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Unique and threatened systems\\\\n2. Extreme weather events\\\\n3. Distribution of impacts\\\\n4. Global aggregate impacts\\\\n5. Large-scale singular events\\\\n\\\\nThese categories provide a framework for assessing risks related to climate change and can be valuable in developing conservation strategies for coral reefs in the Caribbean.&quot;,&quot;The projected impact of the NDCs announced before COP26 on global warming suggests that without additional commitments or actions, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 associated with these NDCs would likely lead to exceeding 1.5\\\\u00b0C warming during the 21st century. This would make it more challenging to limit warming below 2\\\\u00b0C. The emissions linked to these NDCs are expected to be similar to or slightly below 2019 levels, which is higher than what is required for pathways aiming to limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C or 2\\\\u00b0C with immediate and significant global greenhouse gas emission reductions.&quot;,&quot;The AR6 framework assesses future greenhouse gas emissions, climate change scenarios, risks, impacts, and mitigation strategies. It considers socio-economic development, emissions pathways, global surface temperature responses to various scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5), global mean temperature change categorizations (C1\\\\u2013C8), and risk assessments related to increasing warming.&quot;,&quot;Maintaining the 2019 CO2 emission levels from 2020 to 2030 would have a significant impact on the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5\\\\u00b0C and 2\\\\u00b0C warming targets. The remaining carbon budgets for these targets could be quickly exhausted if emissions are not reduced significantly. This implies that if emissions continue at the 2019 levels, the ability to limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C or 2\\\\u00b0C would be severely compromised.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the italicized annotations in the Synthesis Report figures key is to provide simple explanations in non-technical language to help non-experts understand complex content. In the context of GHG emissions and the cost implications of reaching net zero, GHG emissions are related to the cost implications by requiring deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions. Additionally, the deployment of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies is necessary to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions. Achieving net zero GHG emissions involves significant costs associated with reducing emissions and implementing CDR technologies to offset remaining emissions from sectors like agriculture, aviation, shipping, and industrial processes.&quot;,&quot;The symbol &amp;#x27;...&amp;#x27; in the context of net zero pathways in the IPCC report denotes that net zero is not reached for that percentile.&quot;,&quot;Climate change has caused irreversible impacts on ecosystems, including the retreat of glaciers leading to hydrological changes, shifts in mountain and Arctic ecosystems due to permafrost thaw, desertification and land degradation in various regions, and the loss of coastal wetlands due to human pressures, sea level rise, warming, and extreme climate events.&quot;,&quot;The projected impact of sustained warming levels between 2\\\\u00b0C and 3\\\\u00b0C on the Greenland ice sheet is an increase in glacier melt, which is expected to continue due to the longer response timescales of the climate system.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, the projected impact of sustained warming levels between 2\\\\u00b0C and 3\\\\u00b0C on the West Antarctic ice sheet is an increase in global mean sea level rise by about 2 to 6 meters.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report highlights specific risks to food security in Africa, including increased nutrition-related diseases, higher numbers of undernourished people, and decreased snowmelt water availability for irrigation in some snowmelt-dependent river basins. These factors pose significant challenges to food security in the region.&quot;,&quot;About 80% of coal reserves cannot be burned if we aim to limit warming to 2\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;The critical enablers for accelerated climate action identified in the IPCC report include improved availability and access to finance, addressing needs and gaps in finance, broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, increased international cooperation, inclusive governance, coordinated policies, and accelerated international financial cooperation. These factors play a crucial role in advancing climate action and achieving sustainable development goals.&quot;,&quot;Increasing adaptive capacity can minimize the risks associated with involuntary migration and immobility, and it can improve the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made. Policy interventions can also play a role in removing barriers and expanding alternatives for safe, orderly, and regular migration, allowing vulnerable individuals to better adapt to climate change.&quot;,&quot;The factors contributing to higher vulnerability to climate change according to the IPCC report include poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods, inequity, marginalization linked to gender and ethnicity, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity like colonialism, and governance issues.&quot;,&quot;Integrating mitigation and adaptation with sustainable development objectives can yield multiple benefits for human well-being, ecosystem health, and planetary health. This integration can lead to positive interactions that result in large-scale greenhouse gas emission reductions, biodiversity conservation, food security improvements, and other ecosystem services. Additionally, combining these efforts can enhance climate resilience, promote social equity and justice, and contribute to overall sustainable development goals.\\\\n\\\\nIntegrating solar energy and agriculture can enhance sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and sustainable land management practices. This integration can lead to improved biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and local livelihoods while reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change impacts.\\\\n\\\\nIntegrating solar energy with agriculture can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, provide employment opportunities, and support local livelihoods.&quot;,&quot;The title of Section 2 in the IPCC report is \\\\&quot;Current Status and Trends\\\\&quot;.&quot;,&quot;The number mentioned in the IPCC report is 91.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential in addressing climate change, specifically focusing on tropical deforestation and reforestation.&quot;,&quot;As an environmental policy analyst looking into the financial hurdles for developing countries in climate adaptation, the challenges associated with green bonds and similar products in these regions include issues related to integrity, additionality, and limited applicability of these markets. Additionally, there are concerns about the insufficiency of current global financial flows for adaptation, which constrain the implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries. The widening disparities between the estimated costs of adaptation and the actual finance allocated to adaptation pose significant challenges. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive data and inadequate financial resources in many developing countries hinder effective adaptation efforts to reduce associated economic and non-economic losses and damages.&quot;,&quot;The factors identified by the IPCC AR6 that constrain both individual and collective actions towards climate resilient development include:\\\\n1. Poverty, inequity, and injustice\\\\n2. Economic, institutional, social, and capacity barriers\\\\n3. Siloed responses\\\\n4. Lack of finance and barriers to finance and technology\\\\n5. Tradeoffs with sustainable development goals\\\\n\\\\nThese factors play a significant role in hindering efforts to achieve climate resilient development.&quot;,&quot;The global surface temperature increased by around 1.1\\\\u00b0C in 2011-2020 compared to 1850-1900. The main contributors to the observed warming are greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 and methane.&quot;,&quot;The expected impact on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation due to global warming is that it is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios with high confidence. \\\\n\\\\nIncreasing global warming will lead to more constrained and less effective adaptation options for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.&quot;,&quot;Customers can use economic instruments, such as carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, for purchases. \\\\n\\\\nCustomers can track their orders after purchase through a combination of digital technologies that provide real-time updates on the status and location of their orders. This tracking process is typically facilitated through online platforms or mobile applications that offer order tracking functionalities, allowing customers to monitor the progress of their orders from shipment to delivery.&quot;,&quot;Demand-side measures can potentially reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40\\\\u201370% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios. \\\\n\\\\nThe key components of net zero CO2 energy systems include a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil fuels, utilization of Carbon Capture and Storage in remaining fossil fuel systems, electricity systems emitting no net CO2, widespread electrification, alternative energy carriers in applications less amenable to electrification, energy conservation and efficiency, and greater integration across the energy system.&quot;,&quot;The top panel of the report indicates that in 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) for three renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. The panel shows the global costs per unit of energy (USD per MWh) for rapidly changing mitigation technologies, with solid blue lines representing average unit costs and light blue shaded areas showing the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles in each year. The yellow shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel power in 2020.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom panel illustrates the cumulative global adoption for each technology, showing the installed capacity for renewable energy and the number of battery-electric vehicles in millions.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, the benefits of deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Reducing future adaptation costs and losses and damages.\\\\n2. Enhancing sustainable development co-benefits.\\\\n3. Avoiding locking-in emission sources.\\\\n4. Reducing stranded assets and irreversible climate changes.\\\\n\\\\nLimiting global warming to close to 1.5\\\\u00b0C would impact projected losses and damages by:\\\\n\\\\n1. Resulting in reduced projected losses and damages compared to scenarios with higher levels of warming.\\\\n2. Lowering risks of irreversible adverse impacts on ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems.\\\\n3. Mitigating risks such as increased wildfires, mass tree mortality, drying of peatlands, thawing of permafrost, and weakening natural land carbon sinks.\\\\n4. Reducing the need for extensive net negative CO2 emissions to return to a given warming level, making temperature reversal more feasible and sustainable.&quot;,&quot;Factors contributing to severe water scarcity experienced by roughly half of the world&amp;#x27;s population include unsustainable agricultural expansion driven by unbalanced diets, which increases vulnerability to competition for land and water resources. Additionally, increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people to acute food insecurity and reduced water security globally.\\\\n\\\\nRegions and communities most affected by increasing weather and climate extreme events include highly populated coastal regions facing coastal flooding events, mountain regions experiencing cryosphere-related changes, areas with projected increases in heavy precipitation leading to local flooding, and regions vulnerable to compound events like concurrent heatwaves and drought. These impacts have severe consequences for people, infrastructure, economies, food production, health, and ecosystems, especially in tropical regions and for Indigenous Peoples and local communities directly dependent on ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;The projected reductions in net global GHG emissions by 2050 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C are estimated to be 84% below 2019 levels.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context of limiting warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C, &amp;#x27;unabated fossil fuels&amp;#x27; refer to fossil fuels that are produced and used without interventions that significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted throughout their life cycle. This could include measures such as capturing 90% or more of CO2 emissions from power plants or capturing 50 to 80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply.&quot;,&quot;The projected global GHG emissions outcomes from NDCs announced prior to COP26 would likely result in exceeding 1.5\\\\u00b0C of warming and make it more challenging to limit warming to below 2\\\\u00b0C after 2030.\\\\n\\\\nTo be on track to limit global warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C by 2030, a projected reduction in net global GHG emissions of 43% below 2019 levels is required.&quot;,&quot;Some of the geographic regions mentioned in the context include sub-continents, oceanic regions, monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges, and cities. \\\\n\\\\nThe types of climate-related hazards listed are coastal flooding, extreme water levels, compound heat wave and drought events, cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, water availability, heavy precipitation, and rain-generated local flooding.&quot;,&quot;Climatic events have a more severe impact on pathways with lower climate resilient development compared to pathways with higher climate resilient development. Non-climatic events, such as droughts, floods, or pandemics, also have a more severe impact on pathways with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) compared to pathways with higher climate resilient development (green). \\\\n\\\\nDelaying emissions reductions will further increase global warming, which in turn will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options and increase the risks associated with mitigation feasibility. This delay will escalate the projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages, making it more challenging to address climate change effectively.&quot;,&quot;The area of the rectangles in the emissions data visualization represents the total emissions for each region. According to the IPCC report, human-caused climate change is the main driver of tropospheric warming.&quot;,&quot;The cascading effects of climate extreme events on smallholder farmers can lead to significant challenges such as reduced agricultural productivity, impacts on food security, destruction of homes and infrastructure, loss of income and property, and adverse effects on social equity. These impacts can further exacerbate vulnerabilities, especially for smallholder farmers who may already be facing challenges in adapting to changing climate conditions.\\\\n\\\\nExtreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, observed adaptation efforts include sustainable food production, improved forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation, land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, reduced food loss and waste, resilience-building for biodiversity and ecosystem services, urban adaptation innovations, documented adaptation actions in peer-reviewed literature, and the effectiveness of irrigation in reducing drought risk and climate impacts.\\\\n\\\\nSome ecosystems that have already reached hard adaptation limits include terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, future warming will be primarily driven by future greenhouse gas emissions, with cumulative net CO2 emissions playing a dominant role. Additionally, the uncertainty range for global surface temperature changes has been narrowed in the latest IPCC assessment compared to the previous assessment.&quot;,&quot;The observed change in global mean surface air temperature since 1850-1900 according to the IPCC report is approximately 1.1\\\\u00b0C. Additionally, the Arctic sea ice has experienced loss since 1979 according to the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;The best estimates for global warming under different scenarios according to the IPCC report are as follows:\\\\n- SSP1-1.9: 1.4\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP1-2.6: 1.8\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP2-4.5: 2.7\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP3-7.0: 3.6\\\\u00b0C\\\\n- SSP5-8.5: 4.4\\\\u00b0C\\\\n\\\\nThe 1.5\\\\u00b0C global warming level is expected to be reached in the first half of the 2030s in most scenarios and modelled pathways considered, except for the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario where it is projected to be reached in the late 2020s. The median five-year interval for reaching a 1.5\\\\u00b0C global warming level with a 50% probability in the modelled pathways considered is between 2030 and 2035.&quot;,&quot;In SSP-based scenarios, &amp;#x27;SSPx-y&amp;#x27; refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios. &amp;#x27;SSPx&amp;#x27; represents the specific pathway, and &amp;#x27;y&amp;#x27; indicates the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, Wm^-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\\\n\\\\nRCP-based scenarios are denoted as &amp;#x27;RCPy&amp;#x27;, where &amp;#x27;y&amp;#x27; represents the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, Wm^-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.&quot;,&quot;In the context provided, \\\\&quot;maximum potential response\\\\&quot; involves implementing a combination of responses to their full extent, requiring significant additional efforts compared to the present situation, assuming minimal financial, social, and political barriers. The responses considered include exposure and vulnerability assessments, coastal hazard management, in-situ responses like coastal defenses and ecosystem restoration, as well as planned relocation strategies. Forced displacement is not taken into account in this assessment.\\\\n\\\\nRisks to food security are assessed based on the magnitude of adverse consequences, likelihood of adverse consequences, temporal characteristics of the risk, and the ability to respond to the risk through adaptation. The risks are identified considering factors such as the pervasiveness of the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, and potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries.&quot;,&quot;The atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O in 2021 were reported as 415 parts per million (ppm) for CO2, 1896 parts per billion (ppb) for CH4, and 335 ppb for N2O. \\\\n\\\\nThe current concentrations of CH4 and N2O are at levels unprecedented in at least 800,000 years.&quot;,&quot;Some effective adaptation options in the agriculture sector to reduce climate risks include cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level diversification, and sustainable land management approaches.&quot;,&quot;Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) plays three key roles in mitigating climate change:\\\\n\\\\n1. Lowering net CO2 or net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the near term.\\\\n2. Counterbalancing &amp;#x27;hard-to-abate&amp;#x27; residual emissions to help achieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions.\\\\n3. Achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions.\\\\n\\\\nCDR methods differ in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements.&quot;,&quot;Some enabling conditions that could reduce barriers to mitigation, as discussed in the IPCC report, include policy instruments, greater public support, and technological innovation. These factors play a crucial role in overcoming obstacles to mitigation efforts.&quot;,&quot;The levelised cost of energy (LCOE for renewable energy technologies includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions is collective and participatory decision-making processes.&quot;,&quot;A large explosive volcanic eruption in the near term would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change. It would reduce global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for a period of one to three years.&quot;,&quot;The projected reduction in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C is estimated to be 43% below 2019 levels.&quot;,&quot;Some of the irreversible changes projected due to continued greenhouse gas emissions include impacts on major climate system components, intensification of the global water cycle, amplification of permafrost thawing, loss of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, land ice, and Arctic sea ice. Additionally, ocean acidification, ocean deoxygenation, and global mean sea level rise are projected to continue increasing in the 21st century as a result of ongoing greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;,&quot;The five scenarios considered by WGI in the AR6 framework for assessing future greenhouse gas emissions are SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5.&quot;,&quot;The six feasibility dimensions used to assess climate responses and adaptation options in Figure 4.4 are economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical.&quot;,&quot;The factors that exacerbate vulnerability as mentioned in the IPCC report include poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity like colonialism, and inequity and marginalization linked to gender, ethnicity, and low income.&quot;,&quot;In 2021, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O were reported to be:\\\\n- CO2: 415 parts per million (ppm)\\\\n- CH4: 1896 parts per billion (ppb)\\\\n- N2O: 335 parts per billion (ppb)&quot;,&quot;The impacts of climate change on urban settings, as outlined in the IPCC report, include intensified heatwaves, worsened air pollution events, compromised infrastructure functioning, economic losses, disruptions of services, and impacts on well-being. These effects are particularly significant for economically and socially marginalized urban residents, such as those living in informal settlements. Additionally, cities contribute to increased precipitation and runoff intensity, exacerbating the challenges faced in urban areas.&quot;,&quot;Some of the barriers to the implementation of AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use) mitigation options include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Insufficient institutional and financial support\\\\n2. Uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs\\\\n3. Weak governance\\\\n4. Insecure land ownership\\\\n5. Low incomes\\\\n6. Lack of access to alternative sources of income\\\\n7. Risk of reversal\\\\n\\\\nThese barriers can hinder the effective implementation of AFOLU mitigation options.&quot;,&quot;Multi-level, hybrid, and cross-sector governance play a role in facilitating appropriate consideration for co-benefits and trade-offs in land sectors, where decision processes vary from the farm level to national scale.&quot;,&quot;The median cumulative net CO2 emissions across the projected scenarios until reaching net-zero or until 2100 is estimated to be around 500 gigatonnes of CO2.&quot;,&quot;Some of the risks to food and nutritional security include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Availability and access to food\\\\n2. Population at risk of hunger\\\\n3. Food price increases\\\\n4.

These advancements enable improved energy efficiency, facilitate the adoption of low-emission technologies like decentralized renewable energy, and create economic opportunities.&quot;,&quot;The key barriers to the implementation of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) as mentioned in the IPCC report include insufficient financing and a lack of political frameworks and incentives for finance.&quot;,&quot;A projected reduction in mean soil moisture by one standard deviation indicates soil moisture conditions typical of droughts that occurred about once every six years during the period of 1850-1900.&quot;]],[&quot;reference_answer&quot;,[&quot;The best estimate of reaching 1.5\\\\u00b0C of global warming lies in the first half of the 2030s in most of the considered scenarios and modelled pathways.&quot;,&quot;The median projected global emissions for 2030 based on policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2-eq/yr, with a range of 52\\\\u201360 GtCO2-eq/yr.&quot;,&quot;Key barriers include limited resources, lack of private-sector and civic engagement, insufficient mobilisation of finance, lack of political commitment, limited research and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation science, and a low sense of urgency.&quot;,&quot;Many changes due to past and future GHG emissions are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales, especially in the ocean, ice sheets, and global sea level.&quot;,&quot;Options include increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing countries, increasing the use of public guarantees to reduce risks and leverage private flows at lower cost, local capital markets development, and building greater trust in international cooperation processes.&quot;,&quot;If such a low probability event were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.&quot;,&quot;By 3\\\\u00b0C, soft limits are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe (medium confidence).&quot;,&quot;The underlying population assumptions range from 8.5 to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 7.4 to 10.9 billion in 2100 (5\\\\u201395th percentile) starting from 7.6 billion in 2019.&quot;,&quot;Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions.&quot;,&quot;Urban infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation, and energy systems, have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset events, resulting in economic losses, disruptions of services, and impacts to well-being (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;The best estimates of global warming for the different scenarios in the near term are: 1.5 [1.2 to 1.7]\\\\u00b0C (SSP1-1.9); 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C (SSP1-2.6); 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C (SSP2-4.5); 1.5 [1.2 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C (SSP3-7.0); and 1.6[1.3 to 1.9]\\\\u00b0C (SSP5-8.5).&quot;,&quot;Limiting global warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C instead of 2\\\\u00b0C would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks and reduced adaptation needs (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, affecting tens (under low vulnerability and low warming) to hundreds of millions of people (under high vulnerability and high warming), particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations. It will also bring benefits to human well-being and help close adaptation gaps, particularly in this decade.&quot;,&quot;Achieving global net zero GHG emissions requires all remaining CO2 and metric-weighted non-CO2 GHG emissions to be counterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals.&quot;,&quot;Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1\\\\u00b0C above 1850\\\\u20131900 in 2011\\\\u20132020.&quot;,&quot;The adoption and implementation of net zero emission targets by countries and regions depend on equity and capacity considerations.&quot;,&quot;The likely range of human contribution ([0.8-1.3\\\\u00b0C]) encompasses the very likely range of observed warming ([0.9-1.2\\\\u00b0C]).&quot;,&quot;CDR can fulfill three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing \\\\u2018hard-to-abate\\\\u2019 residual emissions to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions.&quot;,&quot;Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole.&quot;,&quot;87%&quot;,&quot;The projected risks and impacts include (a) risks of species losses as indicated by the percentage of assessed species exposed to potentially dangerous temperature conditions, (b) risk to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure to hypothermic conditions that pose a risk of mortality, and (c) impacts on food production, specifically changes in maize yield at projected GWLs.&quot;,&quot;Increasing adaptive capacity minimises risk associated with involuntary migration and immobility and improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, while policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for safe, orderly and regular migration that allows vulnerable people to adapt to climate change (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Projected regional impacts on maize yield reflect biophysical responses to changing temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, wind, and CO2 enhancement of growth and water retention in currently cultivated areas.&quot;,&quot;The four types of assessed modelled global pathways are: 1) Trend from implemented policies, 2) Limit to 2\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;67%) or return warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;50%) after a high overshoot, NDCs until 2030, 3) Limit to 2\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;67%) with immediate action, and 4) Limit to 1.5\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot.&quot;,&quot;Climate-related risks are assessed to be higher than in AR5 for a given level of warming, with risks becoming high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to AR5. Risks, including cascading risks and risks from overshoot, are projected to become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming. Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5\\\\u00b0C than at present (1.1\\\\u00b0C) but lower than at 2\\\\u00b0C. Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;Net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]% below 2019 levels by 2030.&quot;,&quot;Effective adaptation options for vector-borne diseases include surveillance, early warning systems, and vaccine development (very high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Severe water scarcity is experienced due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers, including unsustainable agricultural expansion driven in part by unbalanced diets.&quot;,&quot;Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C (&amp;gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot reach net zero CO2 emissions around 2050.&quot;,&quot;Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through available abatement technologies (e.g., material efficiency, circularity), electrification (e.g., electrothermal heating, heat pumps), and switching to low- and zero-GHG emitting fuels (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia, and bio-based and other synthetic fuels).&quot;,&quot;The lag in adoption of low-emission technologies in most developing countries is due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.&quot;,&quot;Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system.&quot;,&quot;The development of synthetic diagrams was limited due to the paucity of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.&quot;,&quot;Accelerated financial support for developing countries is critical to enhance mitigation and adaptation action (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;The SSP1 pathway illustrates a world with low population growth, high income, and reduced inequalities, with high adaptive capacity. The SSP3 pathway has the opposite trends.&quot;,&quot;In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), the projected net global warming by 2100 is likely 0.4\\\\u00b0C to 0.9\\\\u00b0C relative to 2019.&quot;,&quot;Impacts in ecosystems from slow-onset processes such as ocean acidification, sea level rise, or regional decreases in precipitation have been attributed to human-caused climate change. It has contributed to desertification and exacerbated land degradation, particularly in low lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands, and in permafrost areas. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years due to the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming, and extreme climate events.&quot;,&quot;Synergies are represented by the blue proportion within the bars, trade-offs are represented by the orange proportion, and &amp;#x27;both synergies and trade-offs&amp;#x27; are represented by the striped proportion within the bars.&quot;,&quot;Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas (e.g., new urban infrastructure that cannot be adjusted easily or affordably), agriculture (e.g., using high-cost irrigation in areas projected to have more intense drought conditions), ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally fire-prone areas).&quot;,&quot;SRM approaches introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. They have the potential to offset warming and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not restore climate to a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate change would occur at regional and seasonal scales. A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. SRM would not stop atmospheric CO2 concentrations from increasing nor reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are associated with the potential of SRM approaches to reduce climate change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create international tensions.&quot;,&quot;For remaining carbon budgets, thin lines indicate the uncertainty due to the contribution of non-CO2 warming. For lifetime emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure, thin lines indicate the assessed sensitivity range.&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods such as those of smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and fishing communities.&quot;,&quot;Hatching indicates areas where less than 70% of the climate-crop model combinations agree on the sign of impact and where the two climate-fisheries models disagree in the direction of change.&quot;,&quot;The Reasons for Concern (RFCs) are five globally aggregated categories of risk that evaluate risk accrual with increasing global surface temperature.&quot;,&quot;The lag in adoption of low-emission technologies in developing countries, particularly least developed ones, is due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.&quot;,&quot;In the agriculture sector, adaptation options include cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level diversification, and sustainable land management approaches. These options provide multiple benefits and reduce climate risks.&quot;,&quot;The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.1\\\\u00b0C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future projected risks above it.&quot;,&quot;Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5\\\\u00b0C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9).&quot;,&quot;The RCB for limiting warming to 2\\\\u00b0C with a 67% likelihood is 1150 GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020.&quot;,&quot;Non-climatic risk drivers include competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics.&quot;,&quot;The AR6 framework assesses future greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, risks, impacts, and mitigation by considering socio-economic development and policy, emissions pathways, and global surface temperature responses to five scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) and eight global mean temperature change categorizations (C1\\\\u2013C8).&quot;,&quot;Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, including cash transfers and public works programmes, would increase resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes.&quot;,&quot;The best estimate of reaching 1.5\\\\u00b0C of global warming lies in the first half of the 2030s in most of the considered scenarios and modelled pathways.&quot;,&quot;Very high confidence.&quot;,&quot;The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal, indicating a very high confidence that climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health.&quot;,&quot;The projected global population in low-lying coastal zones is expected to reach more than one billion by 2050 across all five SSPs.&quot;,&quot;Global surface temperature reached 1.1\\\\u00b0C above 1850\\\\u20131900 in 2011\\\\u20132020.&quot;,&quot;Approaches that align goals and actions across sectors provide opportunities for multiple and large-scale benefits and avoided damages in the near term. Such measures can also achieve greater benefits through cascading effects across sectors.&quot;,&quot;International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation goals and climate resilient development. It includes mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors, and groups, and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding needs.&quot;,&quot;The five broad categories of risk communicated by the RFC framework are: RFC1: Unique and threatened systems, RFC2: Extreme weather events, RFC3: Distribution of impacts, RFC4: Global aggregate impacts, and RFC5: Large-scale singular events.&quot;,&quot;Projected global GHG emissions from NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5\\\\u00b0C and also make it harder after 2030 to limit warming to below 2\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;The AR6 framework assesses future greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, risks, impacts, and mitigation. It includes socio-economic development and policy, emissions pathways, and global surface temperature responses to five scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) and eight global mean temperature change categorizations (C1\\\\u2013C8).&quot;,&quot;If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020\\\\u20132030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5\\\\u00b0C (50%), and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2\\\\u00b0C (67%).&quot;,&quot;The italicized annotations provide simple explanations written in non-technical language to help non-experts navigate complex content.&quot;,&quot;Three dots (\\\\u2026) denotes net zero not reached for that percentile.&quot;,&quot;Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw.&quot;,&quot;At sustained warming levels between 2\\\\u00b0C and 3\\\\u00b0C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia (limited evidence).&quot;,&quot;Risk to food security, risk of malnutrition (micronutrient deficiency), and loss of livelihood due to reduced food production from crops, livestock and fisheries.&quot;,&quot;About 80% of coal reserves cannot be burned if warming is limited to 2\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;Finance, international cooperation, and technology are critical enablers for accelerated climate action.&quot;,&quot;Increasing adaptive capacity minimizes risk associated with involuntary migration and immobility and improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made. Policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for safe, orderly, and regular migration that allows vulnerable people to adapt to climate change (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods (e.g., smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fishing communities).&quot;,&quot;Mitigation and adaptation when implemented together, and combined with broader sustainable development objectives, would yield multiple benefits for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;Current Status and Trends&quot;,&quot;40&quot;,&quot;Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential.&quot;,&quot;Challenges remain for green bonds and similar products, in particular around integrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of these markets to many developing countries.&quot;,&quot;Factors that constrain individual and collective actions include poverty, inequity and injustice, economic, institutional, social and capacity barriers, siloed responses, lack of finance, and barriers to finance and technology, and tradeoffs with SDGs.&quot;,&quot;Global surface temperature was around 1.1\\\\u00b0C above 1850\\\\u20131900 in 2011\\\\u20132020, and the observed warming is human-caused, with contributions from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling.&quot;,&quot;The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios, with high confidence, though an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100, with medium confidence. Additionally, with increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective, leading to increased losses and damages, with more systems reaching adaptation limits at higher warming levels.&quot;,&quot;Customers can make a purchase using major credit and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover, as well as digital wallets like PayPal and Google Pay, or bank transfers.

Net zero CO2 energy systems entail a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil fuels, use of Carbon Capture and Storage, electricity systems that emit no net CO2, widespread electrification, alternative energy carriers, energy conservation and efficiency, and greater integration across the energy system.&quot;,&quot;The top panel shows global costs per unit of energy (USD per MWh) for some rapidly changing mitigation technologies, with solid blue lines for average unit costs each year and light blue shaded areas for the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles, indicating that in 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the three renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. The bottom panel illustrates cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW of installed capacity for renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles, highlighting the change over the past decade with a vertical dashed line in 2010 and reflecting different capacity factors, such as wind producing about twice as much electricity as solar PV for the same installed capacity.&quot;,&quot;Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes, though they involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes. Limiting global warming to close to 1.5\\\\u00b0C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages in human systems and ecosystems compared to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all, with the magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks strongly depending on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions.&quot;,&quot;Severe water scarcity is experienced due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers, including unsustainable agricultural expansion driven by unbalanced diets, and the largest impacts of increasing weather and climate extreme events are observed in many locations and/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands, and the Arctic, particularly affecting small-scale food producers, low-income households, and Indigenous Peoples globally.&quot;,&quot;In pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 84 [73 to 98]% below 2019 levels by 2050. In this context, &amp;#x27;unabated fossil fuels&amp;#x27; refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted throughout the life cycle, such as capturing 90% or more CO2 from power plants, or 50 to 80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply.&quot;,&quot;Projected global GHG emissions from NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5\\\\u00b0C and also make it harder after 2030 to limit warming to below 2\\\\u00b0C; to be on-track to limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C, we need much more reduction by 2030.&quot;,&quot;The geographic regions mentioned include Africa, Asia, Australasia, North America, Central America, South America, Europe, and Small Islands, while the climate-related hazards listed include hot extremes, heavy precipitation, and agricultural and ecological drought, including heatwaves.&quot;,&quot;Climatic and non-climatic events, such as droughts, floods, or pandemics, pose more severe shocks to pathways with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) than to pathways with higher climate resilient development (green), and the longer emissions reductions are delayed, the fewer effective adaptation options.&quot;,&quot;The area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions for each region, and it is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver of tropospheric warming.&quot;,&quot;Cascading effects on smallholder farmers include impacts on food, nutrition, livelihoods, and well-being, such as food yield and quality losses, increased food prices, reduced labor capacity, reduced food security, decreased quality of life, increased malnutrition, particularly maternal malnutrition and child undernutrition, reduced soil moisture and health, and reduced household income. Additionally, the frequency of extreme sea level events is expected to increase by 2040, with more frequent and intense events occurring across various regions, including Africa, Asia, Australasia, Central and South America, Europe, North America, and Small Islands.&quot;,&quot;Most observed adaptation efforts are fragmented, small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, and more focused on planning rather than implementation, with uneven distribution across regions and significant adaptation gaps among lower-income groups. Ecosystems that have already reached hard adaptation limits include some warm water coral reefs, coastal wetlands, rainforests, and polar and mountain ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;Future warming will be driven by future emissions and will affect all major climate system components, with every region experiencing multiple and co-occurring changes. The uncertainty range on assessed future changes in global surface temperature is narrower than in the AR5, with the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity narrowed to 2.5\\\\u00b0C to 4.0\\\\u00b0C, based on multiple lines of evidence including improved understanding of cloud feedbacks.&quot;,&quot;The observed change is the warming of global mean surface air temperature since 1850-1900, and the Arctic sea ice has experienced a loss since 1979.&quot;,&quot;The best estimates for global warming under different scenarios are: 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8]\\\\u00b0C for SSP1-1.9, 1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]\\\\u00b0C for SSP1-2.6, 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]\\\\u00b0C for SSP2-4.5, 3.6 [2.8 to 4.6]\\\\u00b0C for SSP3-7.0, and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7]\\\\u00b0C for SSP5-8.5. The 1.5\\\\u00b0C global warming level is expected to be reached in the first half of the 2030s for most scenarios, except for the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), where it is expected in the late 2020s.

RFC1: Unique and threatened systems\\\\n2. RFC2: Extreme weather events\\\\n3. RFC3: Distribution of impacts\\\\n4. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts\\\\n5. RFC5: Large-scale singular events\\\\n\\\\nThese RFCs communicate scientific understanding about the accrual of risk in various categories due to climate change, such as impacts on ecological and human systems, extreme weather events, disproportionate impacts on particular groups, global aggregate impacts on socio-ecological systems, and large-scale abrupt changes caused by global warming.&quot;,&quot;According to the IPCC report, some land-related adaptation actions that can have mitigation co-benefits include sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste.&quot;,&quot;Ocean warming accounts for 91% of the heating in the climate system.&quot;,&quot;The range of years for achieving 100% net zero CO2 pathways according to the data is in the early 2050s.&quot;,&quot;Climate services can contribute to reducing vulnerability of human systems by being demand-driven and inclusive of different users and providers. Additionally, policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection, adaptive safety nets, contingent finance, reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans can help reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, such as cash transfers and public works programs, is also highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nClimate services can contribute to reducing exposure of human systems by being demand-driven and inclusive of different users and providers. This approach can improve agricultural practices, inform better water use and efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning. Additionally, policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection, adaptive safety nets, contingent finance, reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems, combined with effective contingency plans, can further reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems.&quot;,&quot;Around 48% of the global population lives in countries with per capita emissions greater than 6 tCO2-eq.&quot;,&quot;Ecosystem-based solutions for sea level rise offer benefits such as protection against coastal erosion and flooding with very high confidence. Additionally, these solutions can reduce emissions and increase carbon uptake and storage with medium confidence.\\\\n\\\\nEcosystem-based solutions for land subsidence can provide benefits such as protection and restoration of natural ecosystems, which can enhance resilience to climate change impacts. These solutions can also help in reducing risks to biodiversity, water, and food security, while contributing to the maintenance of carbon stocks and sinks. Additionally, inclusive decision-making processes involving local communities and Indigenous Peoples are integral to the success of adaptation efforts related to ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;The range of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potential in end-use sectors by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios is estimated to be between 40% and 70%.&quot;,&quot;The categories of the assessed modelled global pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot according to the IPCC report are C1, C1a, and C1b.&quot;,&quot;The three complementary roles of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) according to the IPCC report are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term.\\\\n2. Counterbalancing &amp;#x27;hard-to-abate&amp;#x27; residual emissions to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions.\\\\n3. Achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions.&quot;,&quot;The observed impacts of climate change on urban infrastructure include compromised transportation, water, sanitation, and energy systems due to extreme and slow-onset events. This has led to economic losses, disruptions of services, and impacts on well-being. Additionally, urban settings have experienced intensified heatwaves, worsened air pollution events, and limited functioning of key infrastructure. These impacts are particularly concentrated among economically and socially marginalized urban residents, such as those living in informal settlements.\\\\n\\\\nClimate change has also caused adverse impacts on the well-being of urban residents, particularly those living in informal settlements. These impacts include compromised urban infrastructure, economic losses, disruptions of services, and increased risks to human health and livelihoods. Urban settings have experienced intensified heatwaves, worsened air pollution events, and limitations in the functioning of key infrastructure due to climate change.&quot;,&quot;The projected impacts of climate change on the availability of snowmelt water for irrigation in snowmelt dependent river basins are severe. Changes in the cryosphere are expected to affect water availability for irrigation due to alterations in snowmelt patterns. This could lead to challenges in managing water resources for agriculture in these regions, impacting food production and potentially worsening existing water scarcity issues.\\\\n\\\\nTo mitigate these impacts, strategies such as implementing on-farm water management practices, enhancing water storage capabilities, promoting soil moisture conservation techniques, and investing in irrigation systems can be effective. Additionally, improving and diversifying cultivars, adopting agroforestry practices, and implementing community-based adaptation strategies are recommended to address the challenges posed by reduced snowmelt water availability for irrigation due to climate change.&quot;,&quot;The expected benefits of accelerated implementation of adaptation responses, according to the IPCC report, include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Benefits to human well-being\\\\n2. Reduction of future adaptation costs and losses\\\\n3. Enhancement of sustainable development co-benefits\\\\n4. Avoidance of locking-in emission sources\\\\n5. Reduction of stranded assets\\\\n6. Mitigation of irreversible climate changes\\\\n\\\\nThese actions may involve higher initial investments and disruptive changes, but they can be managed through enabling conditions and the removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility.&quot;,&quot;The SSP scenarios and RCP scenarios differ in terms of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- SSP scenarios: The SSP scenarios outline different levels of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant futures. They range from very low and low emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) where CO2 emissions decline to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions. The intermediate emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) maintains CO2 emissions around current levels until the middle of the century. The high and very high emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) involve CO2 emissions doubling from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively. These scenarios also consider land use, climate mitigation levels, and air pollution controls for aerosols and non-CH4 ozone precursors.\\\\n\\\\n- RCP scenarios: The RCP scenarios are denoted as RCPy, where &amp;#x27;y&amp;#x27; represents the approximate level of radiative forcing in watts per square meter resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. These scenarios were used to assess regional climate changes, impacts, and risks. They also consider greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant futures in their projections.&quot;,&quot;The range of harmonised GHG emissions across pathways for 2019 in the IPCC report is 53-66 GtCO2-eq.&quot;,&quot;The identified barriers impeding the uptake of low-emission technologies in developing nations, particularly the least developed among them, include limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building according to the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;In the context of the IPCC report&amp;#x27;s maps:\\\\n- Hatching indicates areas where less than 70% of the climate-crop model combinations agree on the impact direction for maize yield.\\\\n- Hatching also indicates areas where less than 70% of the climate-fisheries models agree on the impact direction for changes in maximum fisheries catch potential. It highlights regions where the two climate-fisheries models disagree in the direction of change, showing uncertainty in the consensus among the models regarding the impact direction on maximum fisheries catch potential.&quot;,&quot;Transitioning to clean energy systems offers several ancillary advantages that intersect with multiple Sustainable Development Goals. These include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Enhanced urban and land planning with more green spaces\\\\n2. Reduced air pollution\\\\n3. Promotion of sustainable healthy diets\\\\n4. Improved health outcomes\\\\n5. Creation of employment opportunities\\\\n6. Enhanced energy security\\\\n7. Promotion of equity\\\\n8. Conservation and restoration of ecosystems\\\\n9. Improved agricultural productivity\\\\n10. Enhanced food security\\\\n11. Biodiversity conservation\\\\n\\\\nThese advantages align with various Sustainable Development Goals and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future.&quot;,&quot;The anticipated reduction percentage for methane emissions by the year 2030, compared to the levels recorded in 2019, in pathways aligned with maintaining a global temperature rise to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot is approximately 34%.&quot;,&quot;The absence of a circle on the data visualizations in the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis version 2 database signifies a limitation in assessing sea level changes due to insufficient data. This absence does not necessarily mean the absence of increasing frequencies but rather indicates a lack of data for analysis. It is significant because it highlights the challenges in accurately assessing sea level changes when data is limited. This limitation can affect the precision and reliability of projections and assessments related to sea level changes and associated risks.&quot;,&quot;The anticipated severe impacts on infrastructure, economy, and communities in mountainous regions as a result of changes in the cryosphere include floods, landslides, and water availability. These projections are made with high confidence according to the most recent assessments by the IPCC.&quot;,&quot;Since 2010, the following percentage decreases in unit costs have been observed:\\\\n\\\\n1. Solar Energy: Solar energy has experienced an 85% decrease in unit costs since 2010. This significant cost reduction has led to a large increase in deployment, with solar energy capacity growing by more than 10 times during the same period.\\\\n\\\\n2. Wind Energy: The unit costs for wind energy have decreased by approximately 50% since 2010. This significant cost reduction has led to a substantial increase in the deployment of wind energy technologies globally.\\\\n\\\\n3. Lithium-Ion Batteries: The percentage decrease in unit costs for lithium-ion batteries since 2010 has been significant, leading to increased deployment of these batteries.&quot;,&quot;The updated range for equilibrium climate sensitivity in the IPCC&amp;#x27;s latest assessment report is 2.5\\\\u00b0C to 4.0\\\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\\\u00b0C. This range is narrower than the range presented in the AR5.&quot;,&quot;Climate change can exacerbate challenges to food production and the availability of drinking water through various mechanisms such as reducing food security and affecting water security due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, loss of cryospheric elements, and increased frequency and intensity of climatic extremes. This can hinder efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, climate change has slowed the growth in agricultural productivity globally over the past 50 years, with negative impacts on crop yields in mid- and low latitude regions. Ocean warming and acidification have also adversely affected food production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in certain oceanic regions. Furthermore, unsustainable agricultural expansion driven by unbalanced diets can increase ecosystem and human vulnerability, leading to competition for land and water resources.\\\\n\\\\nRegions expected to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on food production and availability of drinking water include Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Islands, and the Arctic.&quot;,&quot;The latest IPCC report indicates that there is an anticipated doubling in the frequency of marine heatwaves since the 1980s with high confidence. It is also very likely that human influence has contributed to most marine heatwaves since at least 2006.&quot;,&quot;According to the latest IPCC assessment:\\\\n- In the year 2021, the atmospheric concentrations were 415 parts per million (ppm) for carbon dioxide (CO2), 1896 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH4), and 335 parts per billion (ppb) for nitrous oxide (N2O).\\\\n- Comparatively, in previous years, the atmospheric concentrations were reported as 410 ppm for CO2, 1866 ppb for CH4, and 332 ppb for N2O.&quot;,&quot;Approximately 80% of the world&amp;#x27;s coal reserves must remain unutilized to limit global warming to 2\\\\u00b0C with an 83% probability.&quot;,&quot;The various colors and patterns of hexagons in the inhabited regions figure in the IPCC AR6 WGI report correspond to the confidence levels and data availability regarding observed climatic changes. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) indicate low agreement in the type of change for the region as a whole, while grey hexagons represent limited data and/or literature that prevents a comprehensive assessment. Other colors signify at least medium confidence in the observed change. The confidence level for human influence on these observed changes is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for high confidence, two dots for medium confidence, and one dot for low confidence (single, filled dot: limited agreement; single, empty dot: limited evidence).&quot;,&quot;A significant volcanic eruption occurring imminently would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change effects. This would be achieved by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for a period of one to three years. The impact of such an eruption on climate change effects is expected to last for one to three years.&quot;,&quot;The anticipated reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, under pathways designed to keep temperature increases to no more than 1.5\\\\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels with a greater than 50% likelihood and minimal overshoot, is projected to be 84% below 2019 levels.&quot;,&quot;Drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships, including with women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and ethnic minorities can facilitate climate resilient development and has allowed locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions.&quot;,&quot;Near-term projections indicate that global warming will continue to increase mainly due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. This will lead to further increases in climate hazards across all regions in the world, resulting in multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development, and adaptation.\\\\n\\\\nCumulative CO2 emissions can have significant implications on ecosystems and human risk levels. Higher cumulative CO2 emissions can lead to reduced effectiveness of natural land and ocean carbon sinks in slowing down CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere. This can result in increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, impacting ecosystems through factors like wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires. Additionally, higher CO2 emissions can lead to more severe impacts such as extreme heat, extreme precipitation, increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and thawing of permafrost. These impacts can weaken natural land carbon sinks, potentially leading to increased greenhouse gas releases and making it more challenging to reverse temperature increases.&quot;,&quot;The updated likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity in the IPCC&amp;#x27;s assessment is 2.5\\\\u00b0C to 4.0\\\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\\\u00b0C. This range is narrower than the range presented in the AR5 report.&quot;,&quot;The specific barriers in developing countries, especially the least developed ones, that hinder the uptake of low-emission technologies despite the recognized need for such innovations include limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. These factors contribute to the challenges faced in adopting low-emission technologies in these regions, as highlighted in the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;Food security could be significantly impacted by approximately 2\\\\u00b0C global warming, leading to higher projected increases in direct flood damages compared to 1.5\\\\u00b0C global warming without adaptation. Additionally, at this level of warming, there could be very high extinction risks for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots, projected to increase at least tenfold from 1.5\\\\u00b0C to 2\\\\u00b0C. These changes could result in widespread systemic impacts, irreversible changes, and many additional adaptation limits, affecting food availability and quality for populations globally.\\\\n\\\\nThe availability and quality of diets could be impacted by approximately 2\\\\u00b0C global warming, leading to changes that are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people. This effect is expected to particularly affect tens to hundreds of millions of people, especially among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.\\\\n\\\\nLow-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America are predicted to be most at risk in terms of food security due to approximately 2\\\\u00b0C global warming.&quot;,&quot;The projected CO2 emissions for the very low GHG emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 are expected to decline to net zero around 2050. For the low GHG emissions scenario SSP1-2.6, the projected CO2 emissions are expected to decline to net zero around 2070, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions.&quot;,&quot;The projected range of equilibrium climate sensitivity according to the IPCC report is 2.5\\\\u00b0C to 4.0\\\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\\\u00b0C. In terms of regional variations in greenhouse gas emissions, the report outlines different scenarios with varying levels of warming based on different emissions pathways. These scenarios include very low GHG emissions leading to 1.4\\\\u00b0C warming, intermediate GHG emissions leading to 2.7\\\\u00b0C warming, and very high GHG emissions resulting in 4.4\\\\u00b0C warming by 2100.&quot;,&quot;In North America, specific risks to food and nutritional security include costs and damages related to transportation infrastructure, Lyme disease, and reduced viability of tourism-related activities. These risks differ from vulnerabilities in other regions such as Africa, Europe, and the Arctic, where risks include impacts on food production, mortality and morbidity from heat and infectious diseases, coastal flooding, changes in fisheries catch, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;The involvement of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in climate action and addressing challenges such as threats to food security and economic disruption due to environmental changes has enabled deeper ambition and accelerated action in various ways, depending on national circumstances.&quot;,&quot;Regions categorized under Australasia include Australia and New Zealand. Their contributions to global CO2 emissions and non-CO2 emissions are reflected in the regional GHG emissions data provided in the report.&quot;,&quot;The updated likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity as reported in the IPCC&amp;#x27;s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) is 2.5\\\\u00b0C to 4.0\\\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.0\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;The agriculture sector is identified as having the highest percentage of adaptation responses to manage water-related risks and impacts in the projected scenarios and adaptation strategies outlined in the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;The projected consequences of failing to meet investment needs for urgent, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions against climate change include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Continued disproportionate impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable populations.\\\\n2. Increased economic and non-economic losses and damages.\\\\n3. Challenges in redirecting capital towards climate action due to various barriers within and outside the global financial sector. These barriers include inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment opportunities, regional mismatches in capital and investment needs, economic vulnerabilities, limited institutional capacities, and challenges related to risk-return profiles, regulatory environments, institutional safeguards, and scalability of investment opportunities.\\\\n\\\\nFinancial and technological resources are crucial for effective and ongoing implementation of adaptation measures, particularly when backed by institutions with a strong grasp of adaptation needs and capabilities. The IPCC report emphasizes that there will be a substantial need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation, even with extensive global mitigation efforts.&quot;,&quot;The projected impacts on fisheries are expected to vary by region in response to ocean physical and biogeochemical changes.&quot;,&quot;The confidence level in the assertion that demand-side measures could substantially lower global greenhouse gas emissions in end-use sectors by the year 2050 relative to baseline scenarios is high. These measures could lead to a reduction in emissions by 40-70% compared to baseline scenarios. \\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, demand-side measures aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions in end-use sectors by 2050 could have significant socio-economic and environmental impacts. These measures could bring about changes in socio-cultural factors, infrastructure use, and land-use patterns driven by shifts in food demand. \\\\n\\\\nIt is important to consider that while these measures offer substantial emission reduction potential, certain regions and socioeconomic groups may require additional energy and resources to implement these changes effectively. Additionally, the adoption of demand-side mitigation options could influence overall electricity demand, potentially avoiding projected increases in electricity usage due to electrification in other sectors.&quot;,&quot;The projected benefits of accelerated adaptation responses for coastal communities vulnerable to sea level rise include enhanced protection, accommodation, advance planning, and planned relocation. These responses, when implemented early and in alignment with sociocultural values, can effectively address the challenges posed by sea level rise. Additionally, ecosystem-based solutions like wetlands can provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, reducing costs for flood defenses. However, it is important to note that these responses may have site-specific physical limits and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise.\\\\n\\\\nThe increased rates of sea level rise reported by the IPCC are as follows: the average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018.&quot;,&quot;The primary constraints in transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, as outlined in the IPCC report, include challenges related to financial resources, governance structures, institutional frameworks, and policy environments.&quot;,&quot;Delayed mitigation action can have a significant impact on the efficacy of adaptation strategies in extreme climatic conditions and ecosystem responses, as highlighted in the IPCC report. The delay in taking action to mitigate climate change can lead to increased global warming, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of adaptation measures. This can particularly affect strategies such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation and water-related strategies. Furthermore, delayed mitigation action can increase the risks associated with the feasibility of mitigation options, especially those dependent on ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;Projected demand-side measures could potentially contribute to reducing global GHG emissions by 40-70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios. This reduction can be achieved through changes in socio-cultural factors, infrastructure use, and alterations in land-use patterns driven by shifts in food demand. These measures involve implementing new ways of providing end-use services in sectors like buildings, land transport, and food. Additionally, demand-side mitigation options in various sectors can influence overall electricity demand, potentially leading to significant emissions reductions globally by 2050.\\\\n\\\\nIntegrated planning in urban systems that combines physical, natural, and social infrastructure could contribute to the reduction of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 through measures such as sustainable land use and urban planning, sustainable urban water management, biodiversity management, ecosystem connectivity, energy reliability improvements, efficient buildings, public transport promotion, and shifting to sustainable healthy diets. By prioritizing these strategies within urban systems, it is possible to achieve significant reductions in GHG emissions in key sectors such as energy supply, settlements, infrastructure, society, livelihood, and economy.&quot;,&quot;Unabated greenhouse gas emissions are anticipated to lead to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves. Efforts to ensure ecosystem services and support vulnerable communities intersect with the increasing frequency of marine heatwaves by addressing the risks of biodiversity loss in the oceans. These risks include mass mortality events that can impact marine ecosystems and the communities relying on them. By understanding and mitigating the effects of marine heatwaves, initiatives can help protect vulnerable communities that depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods and well-being.&quot;,&quot;The factors identified in the IPCC report that influence the timing at which different countries might achieve net zero emissions include equity considerations, capacity constraints, and the incorporation of equity principles.\\\\n\\\\nEffective adaptation options in the agriculture sector outlined in the report include cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, and sustainable land management approaches. These options provide multiple benefits and reduce climate risks.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, ecosystem-based adaptation approaches such as urban greening, restoration of wetlands, and upstream forest ecosystems are highlighted in the report as effective strategies to reduce various climate change risks and provide multiple co-benefits.&quot;,&quot;For scenarios aiming to cap warming at 1.5\\\\u00b0C, global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 84% by 2050. In contrast, for scenarios targeting a 2\\\\u00b0C limit, global GHG emissions are expected to decrease by 64% by the same year.\\\\n\\\\nThe reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 are correlated with the projected increase in mitigation costs and economic benefits of reduced climate impacts and adaptation needs. The costs of mitigation generally increase with the level of global warming, but even without considering all factors, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2\\\\u00b0C outweigh the cost of mitigation. Limiting global warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C would lead to higher mitigation costs but also increase benefits in terms of reduced impacts, related risks, and reduced adaptation needs. The economic effects of enhanced mitigation actions vary across regions and countries based on factors such as economic structure, emissions reductions, policy design, and international cooperation.&quot;,&quot;Climate change affects food security in different regions by reducing overall agricultural productivity, slowing down growth in agricultural productivity globally, impacting crop yields negatively in mid- and low latitude regions, and causing some positive impacts in high latitude regions. Additionally, climate change contributes to a decrease in maximum catch potential in oceans, affecting food production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in certain oceanic regions. The impacts of climate change on food security are observed globally, with varying effects on different regions based on their geographical locations and vulnerabilities.&quot;,&quot;The unit costs of solar energy decreased from $600 per MWh in 2010 to $150 per MWh in 2019. \\\\nThe unit costs of wind energy decreased from $1200 per MWh in 2010 to $0 per MWh in 2019. \\\\nThe unit costs of lithium-ion batteries decreased from $600 per kWh in 2010 to $150 per kWh in 2019.\\\\n\\\\nThese reductions in unit costs of solar energy, wind energy, and lithium-ion batteries from 2010 to 2019 contribute significantly to the feasibility of system transitions in energy as outlined by the IPCC report. Lower costs make renewable energy sources more competitive with traditional fossil fuels, encouraging their adoption and facilitating the transition to a more sustainable energy system. The decreasing costs of these technologies make it more economically viable to shift towards renewable energy sources, which is crucial for achieving the goals of the energy transition outlined in the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report Synthesis Report highlights that individuals with high socio-economic status play a significant role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. They have the highest potential for emissions reductions and can make impactful changes as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals. The report emphasizes the importance of designing instruments such as taxes, subsidies, prices, and consumption-based approaches to reduce high-emissions consumption while enhancing equity and societal well-being. Promoting behavior and lifestyle changes towards adopting low-GHG-intensive options through policies, infrastructure, and technology is crucial, with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being. Additionally, ensuring equitable access to finance, technologies, and capacity can accelerate mitigation efforts and shift development pathways in low-income contexts. Collaboration among all actors in equitable, just, and enabling ways is essential to achieve fair and sustainable outcomes in climate resilient development.&quot;,&quot;Factors increasing vulnerability to climate change for Indigenous Peoples and local communities include inequity, marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance challenges. \\\\n\\\\nHistorical inequities related to gender, ethnicity, and income have a significant impact on vulnerability to climate change for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report emphasizes the importance of equity, inclusion, and just transitions in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Prioritizing these principles is crucial for achieving progress in adaptation, deeper societal ambitions for mitigation, and sustainable outcomes. Integrating equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, social justice, and inclusivity can lead to more sustainable outcomes and support transformative change for climate resilient development. Additionally, redistributive policies that focus on protecting the poor and vulnerable, implementing social safety nets, and ensuring just transitions can enable deeper societal ambitions and help address trade-offs with sustainable development goals. It is essential to integrate equity, inclusion, and just transitions at all scales to accelerate mitigation efforts and broader climate action, leading to more effective and equitable responses to the challenges of climate change.&quot;,&quot;The likelihood of global warming reaching 1.5\\\\u00b0C between 2021 and 2040 under very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios is high. In the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), CO2 emissions are projected to reach net zero around 2050, with the best-estimate end-of-century warming being 1.4\\\\u00b0C. This scenario indicates that global warming is likely to reach 1.5\\\\u00b0C in the first half of the 2030s, making it probable that this temperature threshold will be achieved within the specified timeframe.&quot;,&quot;The development of synthetic diagrams for regions like Small Islands, Asia, and Central and South America was limited due to several factors. These include the lack of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report highlights that delayed mitigation actions will lead to further increases in global warming. This, in turn, will reduce the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and various water-related options. Furthermore, delayed mitigation actions will increase the risks associated with mitigation feasibility, particularly for options based on ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;The projected global warming outcome for modelled pathways based on policies implemented until the end of 2020 indicates a global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5]\\\\u00b0C by 2100, with a medium level of confidence. This projection suggests that if current policies implemented by the end of 2020 continue, global warming could reach this level by the end of the century.&quot;,&quot;To achieve deep emissions reductions and ensure a liveable and sustainable future for all, rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary. This includes integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, such as cash transfers and public works programs, supported by basic services and infrastructure. Additionally, ensuring equity, inclusion, just transitions, and broad and meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision-making processes at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation and climate action. These actions can help increase resilience to climate change, reduce trade-offs, and lead to more sustainable outcomes and climate-resilient development.&quot;,&quot;The probability of peak global warming remaining under 1.5\\\\u00b0C according to the latest IPCC report is 38%.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report indicates that coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70\\\\u201390% if global warming reaches 1.5\\\\u00b0C. This highlights the significant impact of climate change on coral reef ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;At 4\\\\u00b0C global warming, approximately 50% of tropical marine species are projected to face local extinction. Additionally, biome shifts are expected to occur across 35% of the global land area.&quot;,&quot;The very low GHG emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 projects CO2 emissions to decline to net zero by the year 2050. \\\\nThe low GHG emissions scenario SSP1-2.6 projects CO2 emissions to decline to net zero by the year 2070.&quot;,&quot;The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850\\\\u20131900 to 2010\\\\u20132019 is between 0.8\\\\u00b0C to 1.3\\\\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 1.07\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;The main factors contributing to severe water scarcity experienced by roughly half of the world&amp;#x27;s population include unsustainable agricultural expansion and increasing weather and climate extreme events. These factors have a significant impact on global water resources and contribute to the challenges of water scarcity faced by many regions.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report recommends the following effective adaptation strategies:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Water**: \\\\n   - Improving access to potable water\\\\n   - Reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to extreme weather events\\\\n   - Implementing early warning systems\\\\n\\\\n2. **Food**:\\\\n   - Balanced and sustainable healthy diets\\\\n   - Reduced food loss and waste\\\\n   - Public health policies to improve nutrition\\\\n\\\\n3. **Vector-borne diseases**:\\\\n   - Surveillance\\\\n   - Early warning systems\\\\n   - Vaccine development\\\\n\\\\nThese strategies can help in adapting to the challenges posed by water scarcity, food security, and vector-borne diseases in the face of climate change.&quot;,&quot;The assessed confidence level for the human contribution to the cooling of the lower stratosphere since the mid-20th century in the IPCC report is \\\\&quot;likely / high confidence.\\\\&quot;&quot;,&quot;The estimated range of species extinction risk at a global warming level of 1.5\\\\u00b0C, as per the latest IPCC report, is that 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed are likely to face a very high risk of extinction.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report highlights that if urgent, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions are not taken, the consequences include escalating adverse impacts, related losses and damages due to climate change, and further increases in global warming. This would reduce the effectiveness of many adaptation options and increase risks for mitigation feasibility, especially for options based on ecosystems. It emphasizes the importance of taking action to address these challenges.&quot;,&quot;Coastal cities play a crucial role in advancing climate resilient development due to several key factors:\\\\n\\\\n1. High Population Density: Coastal cities are often located in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, where population density is high. This makes them more vulnerable to the impacts of rising sea levels and extreme weather events caused by climate change.\\\\n\\\\n2. Increasing Risks: Coastal cities face increasing risks from climate-related factors such as sea-level rise, storm surges, and coastal erosion. These risks can have significant impacts on infrastructure, economy, and the well-being of residents.\\\\n\\\\n3. Economic Importance: Coastal cities are vital hubs of economic activity, trade, and commerce. They contribute significantly to national economies and play a crucial role in global supply chains. Ensuring their resilience to climate change is essential for maintaining economic stability and growth.\\\\n\\\\n4. Driving Sustainable Development: Coastal cities have the potential to drive sustainable development actions that integrate adaptation and mitigation efforts. By implementing climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable urban planning, and green technologies, coastal cities can lead the way in building resilient communities and economies.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the significance of coastal cities in advancing climate resilient development lies in their ability to address the challenges posed by climate change, protect vulnerable populations, and promote sustainable growth and development in the face of environmental threats.&quot;,&quot;The limited development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia, and Central and South America in the IPCC report was primarily due to the scarcity of adequately downscaled climate projections. This scarcity was influenced by uncertainties in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.&quot;,&quot;The latest IPCC report highlights that integrating green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses can lead to various benefits. These include:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Reduced Adaptation Costs**: Integration of green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure can help in reducing adaptation costs associated with climate change impacts.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Flood Control**: The combined approach can contribute to effective flood control measures in urban areas.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Sanitation**: It can enhance sanitation systems and improve waste management practices.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Water Resources Management**: The integration can support better water resources management strategies, ensuring sustainable use and conservation.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Landslide Prevention**: Green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure responses can help in preventing landslides and mitigating their impacts.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Coastal Protection**: The integrated approach can provide coastal protection measures, safeguarding coastal areas from erosion and sea-level rise.\\\\n\\\\n7. **Improved Resilience**: By combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure, urban areas can enhance their resilience to climate change impacts.\\\\n\\\\n8. **Enhanced Ecosystem Services**: The integration can promote the delivery of ecosystem services, benefiting both the environment and communities.\\\\n\\\\n9. **Cost-Effective Solutions**: It offers cost-effective solutions for managing environmental challenges in urban areas, ensuring sustainability and efficiency in infrastructure development.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, integrating green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses provides a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change impacts, offering multiple benefits for urban infrastructure development and environmental policy-making.&quot;,&quot;In the context of emissions pathways in the IPCC report, square brackets signify the 5th-95th percentile interval. \\\\n\\\\nIn the context of net zero in the IPCC report, three dots (...) signify that net zero has not been reached for that percentile. \\\\n\\\\nSquare brackets also signify the 5th-95th percentile interval in the context of net zero in the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;The GHG emissions intensity in terms of tCO2-eq per USD1000PPP for Africa in 2018 is 0.78, and for North America in 2018 is 0.30.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2019, around 48% of the global population lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita.&quot;,&quot;Concurrent and cascading risks to human systems posed by climate change include interactions with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, as well as pandemics. Loss of ecosystems and their services can have cascading and long-term impacts, particularly affecting Indigenous Peoples and local communities who rely directly on ecosystems for basic needs. Additionally, increasing transboundary risks are projected across food, energy, and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows, potentially interacting with other crises such as pandemics.\\\\n\\\\nThe exacerbation of risks to food systems and health by climate change is expected to make these risks more severe and challenging to manage. Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change, interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land and pandemics, will contribute to the increased severity of these risks. Loss of ecosystems and their services will have cascading and long-term impacts, particularly affecting Indigenous Peoples and local communities directly dependent on ecosystems. Additionally, transboundary risks are projected to increase across the food, energy, and water sectors due to impacts from weather and climate extremes propagating through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows. These risks may also interact with impacts from other crises, such as pandemics. Furthermore, some responses intended to mitigate climate change risks, like maladaptation and adverse side effects of certain emissions reduction measures, could compound risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.&quot;,&quot;The non-bracketed values in the &amp;#x27;Temperature Change&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;Likelihood&amp;#x27; columns of the IPCC pathways categories represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator.\\\\n\\\\nThe projected timing for CO2 emissions to reach net zero according to the very low and low GHG emissions scenarios in IPCC pathways categories is around 2050 and 2070, respectively.&quot;,&quot;The deployment of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods in climate change mitigation has various impacts, risks, and roles associated with it:\\\\n\\\\n### Potential Impacts:\\\\n- CDR methods can help achieve net negative global CO2 emissions.\\\\n- They can counterbalance &amp;#x27;hard-to-abate&amp;#x27; residual emissions and aid in reaching net zero CO2 or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\\\\n- Methods like afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry, and soil carbon sequestration are widely practiced and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation efforts.\\\\n\\\\n### Risks:\\\\n- Variability in impacts, risks, and co-benefits for ecosystems, biodiversity, and people depending on the specific method, site-specific context, implementation, and scale.\\\\n- Challenges such as dependence on CDR, pressure on land and biodiversity, and uncertainties regarding potential catastrophic damages need to be considered.\\\\n\\\\n### Roles:\\\\n- Lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term.\\\\n- Counterbalancing &amp;#x27;hard-to-abate&amp;#x27; residual emissions to help achieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions.\\\\n- Achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions.\\\\n\\\\nThese factors highlight the complexity and importance of considering the impacts, risks, and roles associated with the deployment of CDR methods in climate change mitigation.&quot;,&quot;In the IPCC report, the three dots (...) signify high confidence in the projected global warming levels. \\\\n\\\\nThe projected pathways in the IPCC report are categorized based on their likelihood of limiting warming to different peak warming levels (if peak temperature occurs before 2100) and 2100 warming levels.&quot;,&quot;By the early 2050s, 100% of the net zero CO2 pathways need to be achieved according to the data provided. The likelihood of peak global warming staying below 1.5\\\\u00b0C is greater than 50% if deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved, reaching net zero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions of other greenhouse gases.&quot;,&quot;The area of the rectangles in the regional GHG emissions figures represents the total emissions for each region. \\\\n\\\\nHuman influence has been identified as the main driver of the global upper ocean warming since the 1970s.&quot;,&quot;The likelihood of peak global warming staying below 1.5\\\\u00b0C is high. Modelled pathways reach net zero CO2 emissions to limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot around the year 2050.&quot;,&quot;Individuals with high socio-economic status play a significant role in emissions as they contribute disproportionately to emissions. They have the highest potential for emissions reductions compared to other socio-economic groups. \\\\n\\\\nThe revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading can be used to support low-income households, among other approaches.&quot;,&quot;The consequences of the current rates of adaptation planning and implementation, as outlined in the IPCC report, indicate that there are many funding, knowledge, and practice gaps that persist for effective execution. It is expected that the existing adaptation efforts will not meet the established goals. At the current pace of adaptation planning and implementation, the adaptation gap is projected to continue expanding. Additionally, soft and hard adaptation limits have already been reached in certain sectors and regions, despite adaptation efforts having mitigated some climate impacts. This situation underscores the need to address financial, governance, institutional, and policy constraints to overcome these limits. The report suggests that transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation strategies can help surpass soft adaptation limits.\\\\n\\\\nLosses and damages due to climate change are expected to increase with every increment of global warming, with a strong concentration among the poorest and most vulnerable populations. These impacts will be unequally distributed across different systems, regions, and sectors, and are not adequately addressed by current financial, governance, and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.&quot;,&quot;The key strategies for reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions according to the IPCC report include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Achieving global net zero emissions by counterbalancing remaining CO2 and non-CO2 emissions with durably stored CO2 removals.\\\\n2. Focusing on sectors and regions to achieve net zero or net negative emissions.\\\\n3. Considering equity and capacity in the adoption of net zero targets.\\\\n4. Addressing implementation challenges such as technology risks, scaling, and costs.\\\\n5. Engaging various stakeholders like policymakers, citizens, private sector, and civil society to influence climate governance and policy outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nPotential barriers to implementing AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use) mitigation options that can affect carbon stored in vegetation and soils include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Insufficient institutional and financial support.\\\\n2. Uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs.\\\\n3. Weak governance.\\\\n4. Insecure land ownership.\\\\n5. Low incomes.\\\\n6. Lack of access to alternative sources of income.\\\\n7. Risk of reversal.&quot;,&quot;The global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1\\\\u00b0C from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020. \\\\n\\\\nThe main human activities responsible for the observed increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since around 1750 include emissions from unsustainable energy use, land use changes, and various consumption and production patterns.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the AR6 integrated assessment framework is to evaluate future greenhouse gas emissions, climate change risks, impacts, and mitigation strategies by considering various socio-economic development scenarios, emissions pathways, global surface temperature responses, and global mean temperature change categorizations.\\\\n\\\\nThe Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) in the IPCC report are designed to span a range of challenges related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. They are used to assess future exposure, vulnerability, and challenges to adaptation in the face of climate impacts. Depending on the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, modelled emissions scenarios based on the SSPs can align with either low or high warming levels. These pathways help in exploring different mitigation strategies that could correspond to various levels of global warming by the year 2100.&quot;,&quot;The limitations of the models used to project the impacts of climate change on fisheries and maize yield include:\\\\n\\\\n1. The models do not account for changes in fishing activities and some extreme climatic conditions.\\\\n2. Projections for the Arctic regions have low confidence due to uncertainties related to modeling multiple interacting drivers and ecosystem responses.\\\\n3. Models focusing on maize yield do not consider factors such as pests, diseases, future agro-technological changes, and some extreme climate responses.\\\\n\\\\nClimatic impact-drivers projected to increase in all regions with high confidence include increases in hot and decreases in cold climatic impact-drivers, such as temperature extremes.&quot;,&quot;The potential trade-offs of technological innovation, according to the IPCC report, include new and increased environmental impacts, social inequalities, rebound effects resulting in lower net emission reductions or even emission increases, and overreliance on foreign knowledge and providers. These trade-offs can be addressed through well-designed policies and governance that consider distributional impacts, rebound effects, and the potential negative consequences of societal digitalization.\\\\n\\\\nPolicy packages can help in addressing the trade-offs and challenges of digitalisation and technological innovation by including a mix of efficiency targets, performance standards, information provision, carbon pricing, finance, and technical assistance. These policies can help realize synergies, avoid trade-offs, and reduce rebound effects. Additionally, appropriately designed policies and governance have been effective in addressing distributional impacts and rebound effects associated with technological innovation.&quot;,&quot;The yellow shading in the top panel (a) of Figure 2.4 represents the range of estimates for the breakdown of the potential into cost categories. \\\\n\\\\nThe vertical dashed line placed in 2010 in the bottom panel (b) of Figure 2.4 signifies the point at which the estimated temperature during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years is shown. This period occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene).&quot;,&quot;The projected near-term GHG emissions pathways in line with policies implemented until the end of 2020 involve modelled global pathways with comparable ambition levels beyond 2030. These pathways extend the policies to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\\\\n\\\\nThe SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios are significant in terms of CO2 emissions as they involve trajectories where CO2 emissions decline to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively. These scenarios also include varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions, indicating a substantial reduction and potential removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. This aligns with the goal of achieving lower levels of global warming and demonstrates a pathway towards carbon neutrality and potentially negative emissions in the future.&quot;,&quot;The projected impacts on food availability at about 2\\\\u00b0C global warming include changes in maize yield and maximum fisheries catch potential. These changes are based on ensemble models driven by outputs from Earth system models, with variations in impact across different regions and sectors.\\\\n\\\\nThe number of undernourished people at about 2\\\\u00b0C global warming is expected to be in the hundreds of millions, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the IPCC AR6 assessment, at about 2\\\\u00b0C of global warming, the risks associated with the unequal distribution of impacts (RFC3), global aggregate impacts (RFC4), and large-scale singular events (RFC5) would be transitioning to high risk levels. The risks related to extreme weather events (RFC2) would be transitioning to very high risk levels. Additionally, the risks linked to unique and threatened systems (RFC1) would be at a very high risk level.&quot;,&quot;The integration of transport and energy infrastructure planning and operations can benefit the environment by:\\\\n\\\\n- Reducing transport-related greenhouse gas emissions through demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies.\\\\n- Supporting the shift to more energy-efficient transport modes by promoting changes in urban form, reallocating street space for cycling and walking, and encouraging consumer behavior changes.\\\\n- Adopting electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity to contribute to environmental sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nClimate resilient development strategies are most effective when:\\\\n\\\\n- They treat climate, ecosystems, biodiversity, and human society as interconnected parts of a unified system.\\\\n- An integrated approach is taken to enhance effectiveness with high confidence.\\\\n- Vulnerability of humans and ecosystems is considered interdependent, emphasizing the importance of interconnected components.\\\\n- Integrated decision-making processes and actions across sectors are implemented to enable climate resilient development with very high confidence.\\\\n- Synergies with and progress towards Sustainable Development Goals further enhance the prospects for climate resilient development.&quot;,&quot;The potential benefits of green/natural infrastructure adaptation responses include reducing adaptation costs and contributing to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses can also reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection.\\\\n\\\\nCombining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses can further enhance these benefits by reducing adaptation costs and contributing to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection.&quot;,&quot;The global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1\\\\u00b0C from the period of 1850-1900 to the period of 2011-2020.&quot;,&quot;The innovations mentioned in the recent IPCC report section about adaptation and resilience finance include forecast-based/anticipatory financing systems and regional risk insurance pools.&quot;,&quot;The total potential of mitigation options presented in the IPCC report is uncertain, with the estimated range of uncertainty typically being 25-50%.&quot;,&quot;The statistical breakdown of net global GHG emissions in 2019 by different sectors is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) had the largest growth in gross emissions.\\\\n- CH4 emissions also increased significantly.\\\\n- The highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), which started from low levels in 1990.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, the specific percentage contributions of each sector were not provided in the information. If you would like more detailed information or specific percentages, please let me know.&quot;,&quot;Integrated mitigation and adaptation options for human health, as outlined in the IPCC report, provide significant benefits. These options incorporate health considerations into various sectors like food, infrastructure, social protection, and water policies. They offer a high level of confidence in improving human health outcomes by promoting balanced and sustainable healthy diets, reducing food loss and waste, and implementing public health policies to enhance nutrition. These integrated approaches not only support health but also contribute to biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts. Additionally, they have the potential to influence food demand, reduce healthcare costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance adaptive capacity, offering a comprehensive and effective strategy for safeguarding human health in the face of climate change.&quot;,&quot;Global net zero CO2 emissions refer to the state where all remaining CO2 emissions are balanced out by durably stored CO2 removals. This means that the amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere is effectively offset by the amount being removed and stored, resulting in a net balance of zero CO2 emissions on a global scale.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, net zero GHG emissions refer to a state where the total amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere is balanced by an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere, typically through processes like carbon capture and storage. This balance helps in achieving a state where the overall impact of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions on the climate is minimized.&quot;,&quot;The factors that influence the effectiveness of climate governance as outlined in the IPCC report include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Inclusive decision processes\\\\n2. Allocation of appropriate resources\\\\n3. Institutional review, monitoring, and evaluation\\\\n4. Multi-level, hybrid, and cross-sector governance\\\\n5. Partnerships between various groups in society\\\\n6. Consideration of climate justice\\\\n7. Drawing on diverse knowledge and collaborations with different stakeholders such as women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and ethnic minorities\\\\n\\\\nThese elements are considered crucial for effective climate governance according to the IPCC report.&quot;,&quot;Some of the barriers to the implementation of AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use) mitigation include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Insufficient institutional and financial support\\\\n2. Uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs\\\\n3. Weak governance\\\\n4. Insecure land ownership\\\\n5. Low incomes\\\\n6. Lack of access to alternative sources of income\\\\n7. Risk of reversal\\\\n\\\\nThese barriers can hinder the effective implementation of AFOLU mitigation efforts.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report discusses projected regional impacts on food production, focusing on changes in maize yield and maximum fisheries catch potential at different projected global warming levels. It includes data from multiple models and projects these impacts for the future based on various scenarios. The report also highlights uncertainties and limitations in the models used, such as not accounting for certain factors like pests, diseases, and extreme climate responses.&quot;,&quot;Factors influencing the effectiveness of medium- and long-term pathways in achieving climate resilient development include enabling conditions, barriers reduction, equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid transitions in sectors and systems, synergies with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, international cooperation, technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems, and regions.&quot;,&quot;The dimensions of risk include the magnitude of adverse consequences, likelihood of adverse consequences, temporal characteristics of the risk, and the ability to respond to the risk through adaptation. These dimensions are assessed based on factors such as the pervasiveness of consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, and potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries.&quot;,&quot;The report mentions varying likelihoods of peak global warming staying below different thresholds. Here are the details:\\\\n- For global warming staying below 1.5\\\\u00b0C, the likelihood ranges from 11% to 38%.\\\\n- For staying below 2.0\\\\u00b0C, the likelihood is higher, ranging from 59% to 90%.\\\\n- The report also states that for staying below 3.0\\\\u00b0C, the likelihood is consistently at 100% in the scenarios considered.&quot;,&quot;Could you please provide more context or specify the temperature range you are referring to when you mention a \\\\&quot;sharp decline\\\\&quot;?&quot;,&quot;The factors mentioned in the IPCC report that relate to the exacerbation of vulnerability in some regions and communities include poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods, inequity, marginalization linked to gender and ethnicity, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity like colonialism, and governance issues.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report highlights that combining mitigation and adaptation strategies with sustainable development objectives offers multiple benefits for human well-being, ecosystem health, and planetary health. Implementing these strategies together can lead to positive interactions and significant advantages in near-term climate policies across various regions, sectors, and systems. For example, actions like AFOLU mitigation in land-use change and forestry can result in substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions while also benefiting biodiversity, food security, wood supply, and other ecosystem services. Adaptation measures in land, ocean, and ecosystems can have widespread benefits for food security, nutrition, health, well-being, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Urban systems are also crucial for climate-resilient development, where integrated policies can generate gains in adaptation or mitigation while promoting equity and human well-being. Integrated policy packages can enhance the incorporation of considerations like equity, gender equality, and justice, maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation efforts.&quot;,&quot;The factors determining the magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks include changes in hazard level, population exposed, and vulnerability of people, assets, or ecosystems. These factors contribute to the severity and frequency of compound and cascading climate risks in the near term, impacting various sectors and regions through interconnected natural and societal pathways.&quot;,&quot;Projected climate-related risks to food availability and diet quality at about 2\\\\u00b0C warming include estimated increases in nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, particularly affecting tens to hundreds of millions of individuals, especially among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America. Additionally, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt-dependent river basins by up to 20% with medium confidence.\\\\n\\\\nRegions most affected by these projected risks include sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America, particularly impacting low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in these regions.&quot;,&quot;The projected increase in extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is expected to rise at least tenfold with a global warming increase from 1.5\\\\u00b0C to 3\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;The projected increase in extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots due to a rise in global warming from 1.5\\\\u00b0C to 3\\\\u00b0C is at least tenfold.&quot;]],[&quot;reference_answer&quot;,[&quot;Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 2\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70\\\\u201390% at 1.5\\\\u00b0C of global warming.&quot;,&quot;The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25\\\\u201350%.&quot;,&quot;The proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with increasing cumulative net CO2 emissions.&quot;,&quot;Hatching indicates areas where less than 70% of the climate-crop model combinations agree on the sign of impact for maize yield, and where the two climate-fisheries models disagree in the direction of change for fisheries catch potential.&quot;,&quot;The global reasons for concern (RFCs) in terms of global surface temperature change relative to 1850-1900 are depicted with a temperature scale ranging from 0\\\\u00b0C to 5\\\\u00b0C, showing various impacts such as damage to salt marshes, rocky shores, seagrass meadows, warm-water corals, and kelp forests, as well as risks like wildfire, dryland water scarcity, heat-related morbidity and mortality, and permafrost degradation, with a confidence level assigned to transition range and midpoint of transition. The comparison is shown through a visual scale with dots indicating the level of impact or risk, which increases with higher temperatures.&quot;,&quot;Land-related adaptation actions that can have mitigation co-benefits include sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste.&quot;,&quot;Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system.&quot;,&quot;2050-2055 [2035-2070] and 2055-2060 [2045-2070]&quot;,&quot;Climate services that are demand-driven and inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural practices, inform better water use and efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning.&quot;,&quot;Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita.&quot;,&quot;Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defenses.

Models do not represent changes in fishing activities and some extreme climatic conditions.&quot;,&quot;high confidence&quot;,&quot;Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, and bring benefits to human well-being.&quot;,&quot;The primary constraints in transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation are vested interests, economic lock-ins, institutional path dependencies, and prevalent practices, cultures, norms, and belief systems.&quot;,&quot;Delayed mitigation action will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and many water-related options, as well as increasing mitigation feasibility risks, such as for options based on ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;Demand-side measures can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios.&quot;,&quot;Additional warming will lead to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;The timing of when different countries reach net zero emissions is influenced by the potential to reduce GHG emissions and undertake carbon dioxide removal, the associated costs, availability of policy mechanisms to balance emissions and removals between sectors and countries, equity and capacity considerations, and the incorporation of equity principles.&quot;,&quot;In pathways that limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C, global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050. For pathways that limit warming to 2\\\\u00b0C, the reduction is projected to be 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050.&quot;,&quot;Climate change has reduced food security due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, loss of cryospheric elements, and greater frequency and intensity of climatic extremes, thereby hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals.&quot;,&quot;From 2010-2019, the unit costs of solar energy decreased by 85%, wind energy by 55%, and lithium-ion batteries by 85%.&quot;,&quot;The Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarizes the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on peer-reviewed scientific, technical, and socio-economic literature since the publication of the IPCC\\\\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014.&quot;,&quot;Vulnerability is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities.&quot;,&quot;Equity, inclusion, and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, leading to more sustainable outcomes, reducing trade-offs, supporting transformative change, and advancing climate resilient development.&quot;,&quot;Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5\\\\u00b0C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9).&quot;,&quot;The development was limited due to the paucity of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.&quot;,&quot;Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming which will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and many water-related options, as well as increasing mitigation feasibility risks, such as for options based on ecosystems.&quot;,&quot;The projected global warming outcomes of the modelled pathways based on policies implemented until the end of 2020 are in line with the trend from implemented policies, which are extended with comparable ambition levels beyond 2030.&quot;,&quot;Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.&quot;,&quot;38% [33-58%]&quot;,&quot;Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70\\\\u201390% at 1.5\\\\u00b0C of global warming.&quot;,&quot;Beyond 4\\\\u00b0C of warming, projected impacts include local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area.&quot;,&quot;The very low GHG emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 projects CO2 emissions to decline to net zero around 2050, and the low GHG emissions scenario SSP1-2.6 projects CO2 emissions to decline to net zero around 2070.&quot;,&quot;The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850\\\\u20131900 to 2010\\\\u20132019 is 0.8\\\\u00b0C to 1.3\\\\u00b0C.&quot;,&quot;Severe water scarcity experienced by roughly half of the world&amp;#x27;s population is due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers.&quot;,&quot;Effective adaptation options for water, food, and vector-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to extreme weather events, improved early warning systems, surveillance, and vaccine development.&quot;,&quot;The assessed confidence level for the human contribution to the cooling of the lower stratosphere since the mid-20th century is &amp;#x27;very likely&amp;#x27;.&quot;,&quot;At a global warming level of 1.5\\\\u00b0C, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction.&quot;,&quot;Without urgent, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations.&quot;,&quot;Coastal cities and settlements play an important role in advancing climate resilient development due to the high number of people living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, the escalating and climate compounded risk that they face, and their vital role in national economies and beyond (high confidence).&quot;,&quot;The development was limited due to the scarcity of adequately downscaled climate projections, uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries within a region, and the few numbers of impact and risk projections for different warming levels.&quot;,&quot;Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection.&quot;,&quot;In the IPCC report&amp;#x27;s assessment, the square brackets represent the 5th-95th percentile interval for the projected scenarios, while three dots (...) denote that net zero is not reached for that percentile.&quot;,&quot;Based on the 2018 data, the GHG emissions intensity for Africa is 0.78 tCO2-eq per USD1000PPP and for North America is 0.31 tCO2-eq per USD1000PPP. Around 48% of the global population lives in countries emitting more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, and another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita.&quot;,&quot;Climate change poses concurrent and cascading risks to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure, and health, which will be exacerbated by factors such as sudden food production losses from heat and drought, reduced labour productivity due to heat, increased food prices, decreased household incomes, and heightened health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality, particularly in tropical regions. These risks are intensified when combined with non-climatic drivers like land competition and pandemics.&quot;,&quot;The non-bracketed values in the &amp;#x27;Temperature Change&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;Likelihood&amp;#x27; columns represent the 50th percentile across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. CO2 emissions are projected to reach net zero around 2050 for the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) and around 2070 for the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6).&quot;,&quot;The impacts and risks of CDR deployment are highly variable and can affect ecosystems, biodiversity, and people depending on the method and context, while the roles of CDR in climate change mitigation include lowering net emissions in the near term, counterbalancing residual emissions to reach net zero, and achieving net negative emissions if deployed at sufficient levels.&quot;,&quot;The three dots (...) in the IPCC report&amp;#x27;s projected global warming levels signify that the value cannot be given, while the projected pathways are categorized according to their likelihood of limiting warming to different peak warming levels (if peak temperature occurs before 2100) and 2100 warming levels.&quot;,&quot;100% of the net zero CO2 pathways need to be achieved by 2050-2055, and the likelihood of peak global warming staying below 1.5\\\\u00b0C is 38% [33-58%].&quot;,&quot;In the regional GHG emissions figures, the area of the rectangles represents the total emissions for each region, and human influence has been the main driver of the global upper ocean warming since the 1970s.&quot;,&quot;The likelihood of peak global warming staying below 1.5\\\\u00b0C ranges from 11% to 38%, and modelled pathways that aim to limit warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot reach net zero CO2 emissions around 2050.&quot;,&quot;Individuals with high socio-economic status play a significant role in contributing to emissions but also have the highest potential for emissions reductions as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals, while the revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading can be used to support equity and distributional goals, such as helping low-income households.&quot;,&quot;The IPCC report indicates that at current rates of adaptation planning and implementation, the adaptation gap will continue to grow, with efforts falling short of meeting goals, and that losses and damages due to climate change are unequally distributed and not adequately addressed, especially in vulnerable developing countries.&quot;,&quot;The key strategies for reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, demand-side measures, improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The potential barriers to implementing AFOLU mitigation options are impacts of climate change, competing land demands, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, complex land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. These barriers can put at risk the carbon stored in vegetation and soils, making it susceptible to future loss or sink reversal due to climate change, disturbances, or poor management.&quot;,&quot;The global surface temperature has increased by around 1.1\\\\u00b0C above 1850\\\\u20131900 in 2011\\\\u20132020, and the main human activities responsible for the observed increases in greenhouse gas concentrations since around 1750 include emissions from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, and certain patterns of consumption and production.&quot;,&quot;The AR6 integrated assessment framework in the IPCC report is designed to assess future greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, risks, impacts, and mitigation, incorporating socio-economic development and policy, emissions pathways, and temperature responses to scenarios. Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) within this framework explore different challenges to mitigation and adaptation, shaping future vulnerability and exposure, and are linked to potential low or high warming levels based on GHG mitigation efforts.&quot;,&quot;The limitations of the models include not representing changes in fishing activities, pests, diseases, future agro-technological changes, some extreme climatic conditions, and the assumption that irrigated areas are not water-limited. With high confidence, it is projected that hot climatic impact-drivers will increase and cold ones will decrease in all regions.&quot;,&quot;Technological innovation can involve trade-offs such as environmental impacts, social inequalities, rebound effects, and overdependence on foreign knowledge and providers, according to the IPCC report. Policy packages can address these challenges by implementing a mix of efficiency targets, performance standards, information provision, carbon pricing, finance, and technical assistance to realize synergies, avoid trade-offs, and reduce rebound effects.&quot;,&quot;The yellow shading in the top panel (a) of Figure 2.4 indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020, corresponding to USD 55 to 148 per MWh, while the vertical dashed line in 2010 in the bottom panel (b) signifies the change in cumulative global adoption for each technology over the past decade.&quot;,&quot;The projected near-term GHG emissions pathways, based on policies implemented until the end of 2020, are categorized as &amp;#x27;Trend from implemented policies&amp;#x27;, while the SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios are significant as they envision CO2 emissions reaching net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, with subsequent net negative CO2 emissions.&quot;,&quot;At about 2\\\\u00b0C global warming, food availability is expected to decrease and nutrition-related diseases are estimated to increase, affecting tens to hundreds of millions, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries. The IPCC AR6 indicates that the risks associated with the unequal distribution of impacts (RFC3), global aggregate impacts (RFC4), and large-scale singular events (RFC5) would be transitioning to high, with extreme weather events (RFC2) risks transitioning to very high, and unique and threatened systems (RFC1) risks being very high.&quot;,&quot;Integrating transport and energy infrastructure planning and operations can effectively reduce environmental, social, and economic impacts, aiding in the decarbonisation of these sectors, while the most effective climate resilient development strategies are those that view climate, ecosystems, biodiversity, and human society as interconnected parts of a whole system, both with high confidence.&quot;,&quot;Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal protection.&quot;,&quot;The global surface temperature was around 1.1\\\\u00b0C above 1850\\\\u20131900 in 2011\\\\u20132020.&quot;,&quot;Innovations in adaptation and resilience finance include forecast-based/anticipatory financing systems and regional risk insurance pools.&quot;,&quot;The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25\\\\u201350%.&quot;,&quot;In 2019, approximately 34% of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% from industry, 22% from AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use), 15% from transport, and 6% from buildings.&quot;,&quot;Human health will benefit from integrated mitigation and adaptation options that mainstream health into food, infrastructure, social protection, and water policies. Balanced and sustainable healthy diets and reduced food loss and waste present important opportunities for adaptation and mitigation while generating significant co-benefits in terms of biodiversity and human health.&quot;,&quot;Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions requires all remaining anthropogenic CO2 emissions to be balanced by durably stored CO2 from anthropogenic removal, which is a requirement to stabilize CO2-induced global surface temperature increase. Net zero GHG emissions, on the other hand, require metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions to equal CO2 removal. Net zero CO2 emissions are reached before net zero GHGs.&quot;,&quot;Effective climate governance is influenced by factors such as providing overall direction based on national circumstances, setting targets and priorities, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, enhancing monitoring and evaluation, regulatory certainty, prioritizing inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, improving access to finance and technology, and drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships.&quot;,&quot;Barriers to implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal.&quot;,&quot;Projected regional impacts on food production reflect biophysical responses to changing temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, wind, and CO2 enhancement of growth and water retention in currently cultivated areas.
